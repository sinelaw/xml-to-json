Vesicular lesions are uncommon. Symptoms, which may seem out of proportion to the visible skin lesions, may persist for hours or days after the initial phototoxic reaction. Photosensitivity usually remains for life. Multiple episodes of acute photosensitivity may lead to chronic changes of sun-exposed skin (lichenification, leathery pseudovesicles, grooving around the lips) and loss of lunulae of the nails. Approximately 20%-30% of individuals with EPP have some degree of liver dysfunction, which is typically mild with slight elevations of the liver enzymes. Up to 5% may develop more advanced liver disease which may be accompanied by motor neuropathy, similar to that seen in the acute porphyrias. Except for the small minority with advanced liver disease, life expectancy is not reduced."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"Detection of markedly increased free erythrocyte protoporphyrin is the most sensitive and specific biochemical diagnostic test for EPP. Identification of biallelic mutations in FECH, encoding ferrochelatase, confirms the diagnosis."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Treatment of manifestations: There is no FDA-approved treatment for this disease or specific treatment for the acute photosensitivity. The pain is not responsive to narcotic analgesics. The only effective current treatment is prevention of the painful attacks by avoidance of sun/light (including the long-wave ultraviolet light sunlight that passes through window glass) through use of protective clothing (e.g., long sleeves, gloves, wide-brimmed hats, protective tinted glass for cars and windows). Although topical sunscreens are typically not useful, some tanning products containing creams which cause increased pigmentation may be helpful. Oral Lumitene™ (β-carotene) may improve tolerance to sunlight by causing mild skin discoloration due to carotenemia. Severe liver complications are difficult to treat: cholestyramine and other porphyrin absorbents (to interrupt the enterohepatic circulation of protoporphyrin and promote its fecal excretion) and plasmapheresis and intravenous hemin are sometimes beneficial. Liver transplantation may be required. Prevention of secondary complications: Vitamin D supplementation to prevent vitamin D insufficiency due to sun avoidance. Surveillance: Monitoring of: hepatic function every 6-12 months and hepatic imaging if cholelithiasis is suspected; erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels (free and zinc-chelated), hematologic indices, and iron profile annually; vitamin D 25-OH levels. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sunlight and UV light; for those with hepatic dysfunction, drugs that may induce cholestasis (e.g., estrogens); for those with cholestatic liver failure, use of protective filters for artificial lights in the operating room to avoid phototoxic damage Evaluation of relatives at risk: If both FECH mutations have been identified in an affected family member, at-risk relatives with biallelic mutations can be tested as newborns or infants to allow early intervention (sun protection) and future monitoring for signs of liver dysfunction. Therapies under investigation: Clinical trials are underway for afamelanotide, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone analogue, which increases skin pigmentation by increasing melanin production."},{"Label":"GENETIC COUNSELING","value":"EPP is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

CGD is characterized by severe recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and dysregulated inflammatory response resulting in granuloma formation and other inflammatory disorders such as colitis. Infections typically involve the lung (pneumonia), lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), liver (abscess), bone (osteomyelitis), and skin (abscesses or cellulitis); granulomas typically involve the genitourinary system (bladder) and gastrointestinal track (often the pylorus initially, and later the esophagus, jejunum, ileum, cecum, rectum, and perirectal area). Some males with X-linked CGD have McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome as the result of a contiguous gene deletion. CGD may present any time from infancy to late adulthood; however, the vast majority of affected individuals are diagnosed before age five years. Use of antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy has greatly improved overall survival."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"CGD is diagnosed by tests that measure neutrophil superoxide production via the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex: the dihydrorhodamine (DHR) test has largely replaced the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test, the oldest and most recognized diagnostic test for CGD. CGD is caused by mutation of one of five genes that encode the subunits of phagocyte NADPH oxidase: biallelic mutations in CYBA, NCF1, NCF2, and NCF4 cause autosomal recessive CGD (AR-CGD); mutation of CYBB causes X-linked CGD. Molecular genetic testing for all five genes is available in clinical laboratories."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Treatment of manifestations: A definitive microbiologic diagnosis is essential to proper treatment of infections. Newer azole drugs (voriconazole and posaconazole) have expanded therapeutic options for fungal infections. Long courses of antimicrobials are often needed for adequate treatment. Abscesses may require percutaneous drainage or excisional surgery. Simultaneous administration of antimicrobials and corticosteroids can help resolve the associated heightened inflammatory response, including colitis. Prevention of primary manifestations: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only known cure for CGD; however, indications for HSCT are yet to be resolved. Antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis is the cornerstone of prevention; immunomodulatory therapy with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is part of the prophylactic regimen in many centers. Surveillance: Regular follow-up visits can aid in early detection and treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections and non-infectious complications such as colitis, pulmonary granulomas, and pulmonary fibrosis. Agents/circumstances to avoid: (1) Decayed organic matter (e.g., mulching, gardening, leaf raking, house demolition) as inhalation of fungal spores can result in fulminant pneumonitis; (2) Persons with CGD and McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome: blood transfusions that are Kell antigen positive.

Chapter 2 describes screening and assessment tools that can be used to determine whether a client has a history of childhood abuse or neglect; Chapter 3 presents guidelines on treating clients with histories of child abuse or neglect and referring them to mental health care treatment when necessary. Chapter 4 discusses the personal issues counselors may encounter (e.g., countertransference) when working with clients with histories of abuse or neglect and offers suggestions for addressing them. In Chapters 5 and 6, the focus shifts to adults in treatment who may be abusing or neglecting their own children. Chapter 5 shows how alcohol and drug counselors can identify whether their clients are at risk of or are currently abusing or neglecting their children. It discusses what alcohol and drug counselors can do to break the cycle of child abuse and neglect, including how to work with child protective service agencies within the child welfare system.

The traditional approach to managing viral diseases has been to prevent infection through the use of vaccines. As discussed in the first section of this chapter, traditional vaccines are intended to induce prophylactic immunity that will protect vaccinated individuals when they subsequently encounter the pathogen. Successful immunization of some (but not necessarily all) potentially infectable individuals in a population has been effective in controlling many viral diseases (e.g., the Salk and Sabin vaccines for poliomyelitis). Unvaccinated individuals in such a population are also less likely to become infected due to “herd immunity”—the risk of exposure is reduced because most individuals in the group are immune and thus unlikely to become productively infected."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A6707","book":"rv","value":"Immunological Approaches to Controlling Retroviral Infection"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A6774","book":"rv","value":"Pharmacologic Approaches"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A6807","book":"rv","value":"Summary and Perspectives"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A6808","book":"rv","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21433345","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

The term “retroviruses” has now largely supplanted the earlier designation, “RNA tumor viruses,” recognizing that reverse transcription typifies this class of viruses better than any other property. The suggestion that some RNA viruses might replicate via a DNA intermediate that was subsequently incorporated into the host genome was first made by Howard Temin. By the 1960s, studies of bacteriophage had provided precedents for the integration of viral DNA into the host genome, and thus the most controversial aspect of Temin's proposal was the suggestion that the genome of an RNA virus could be converted into DNA. The stunning finding of an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase (RT)—made independently by Temin and by Baltimore, who looked for and found the activity in purified virions—caught the scientific world off guard. It was then believed that reverse transcription flagrantly violated the central dogma of molecular biology—that genetic information always flowed from DNA to RNA to protein (Baltimore 1970; Temin and Mizutani 1970). The discovery that information could flow from RNA to DNA added considerable weight to Temin's earlier experiments which showed that the replication of retroviruses was sensitive to inhibitors of DNA synthesis. The ability of retroviruses to make a DNA copy of their genome and insert it into the genome of the host explains much of the biology of these viruses: their ability to establish persistent infections and to produce chronically infected cells, and the ability of a subset of retroviruses to transform infected cells rapidly and efficiently. Now, many years later, it is clear that RT is required for the replication of several classes of transposable elements and for certain plant and animal viruses. The AIDS pandemic has invigorated interest in RT because the enzyme plays a central part in retroviral replication and is an important therapeutic target (see Chapter 12. Although it is outside the scope of this chapter, it should be remembered that RT has had a critical role in the development of modern biology: The ability to convert RNA into DNA has been as important to molecular biologists as it has been to retrovirologists. It is worth taking a moment to reflect on how much more difficult it would have been to solve the puzzles posed by the organization and expression of genes in higher eukaryotes if RT did not exist. A number of reviews that focused specifically on RT or include RT as a major theme have recently appeared (see, e.g., Varmus and Brown 1989; Goff 1990; Whitcomb and Hughes 1992; Skalka and Goff 1993). This chapter focuses on an understanding of the process of reverse transcription in the retroviral life cycle and on ways in which the properties of retroviral RT relate to retroviral replication."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1054","book":"rv","value":"Overview of Reverse Transcription"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1064","book":"rv","value":"Reverse Transcription of the Viral Genome in vivo"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1076","book":"rv","value":"Biochemistry of Reverse Transcription"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1097","book":"rv","value":"Special Biological Features of Reverse Transcription"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1110","book":"rv","value":"Conclusions"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1111","book":"rv","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21433342","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

In addition, there has, during the course of evolution, been an imposition of a broad division of the two halves of the inner plexiform layer into the top half, allowing only interactions for the OFF-center ganglion cell pathways and in the bottom half, only for the ON-center ganglion cell pathways. Bipolar and ganglion cells are chiefly responsible for the bisublaminar organization, but amacrine cells, particularly if they are of the sustained physiological types, are also drawn in. However, many amacrine cells are diffuse or bistratified and serve to connect the ON- and OFF-center neuropils, whereas still others stratify in such a manner at the border between the two functional neuropils, to receive both ON and OFF inputs to drive them. Such amacrine cells may be in the majority in the vertebrate retina and are thought to be involved more in temporal facets of retinal performance.

Infection is distinguished from disease, a morbid process that does not necessarily involve infection (diabetes, for example, is a disease with no known causative agent). Bacteria can cause a multitude of different infections, ranging in severity from inapparent to fulminating. Table 7-1 lists these types of infections. The capacity of a bacterium to cause disease reflects its relative pathogenicity. On this basis, bacteria can be organized into three major groups. When isolated from a patient, frank or primary pathogens are considered to be probable agents of disease (e.g., when the cause of diarrheal disease is identified by the laboratory isolation of Salmonella spp. from feces). Opportunistic pathogens are those isolated from patients whose host defense mechanisms have been compromised. They may be the agents of disease (e.g., in patients who have been predisposed to urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli by catheterization). Finally, some bacteria, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, are considered to be nonpathogens, because they rarely or never cause human disease. Their categorization as nonpathogens may change, however, because of the adaptability of bacteria and the detrimental effect of modern radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy on resistance mechanisms. In fact, some bacteria previously considered to be nonpathogens are now known to cause disease. Serratia marcescens, for example, is a common soil bacterium that causes pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia in compromised hosts. Virulence is the measure of the pathogenicity of an organism. The degree of virulence is related directly to the ability of the organism to cause disease despite host resistance mechanisms; it is affected by numerous variables such as the number of infecting bacteria, route of entry into the body, specific and nonspecific host defense mechanisms, and virulence factors of the bacterium. Virulence can be measured experimentally by determining the number of bacteria required to cause animal death, illness, or lesions in a defined period after the bacteria are administered by a designated route. Consequently, calculations of a lethal dose affecting 50 percent of a population of animals (LD50) or an effective dose causing a disease symptom in 50 percent of a population of animals (ED50) are useful in comparing the relative virulence of different bacteria. Pathogenesis refers both to the mechanism of infection and to the mechanism by which disease develops. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the many bacterial virulence factors and, where possible, to indicate how they interact with host defense mechanisms and to describe their role in the pathogenesis of disease. It should be understood that the pathogenic mechanisms of many bacterial diseases are poorly understood, while those of others have been probed at the molecular level. The relative importance of an infectious disease to the health of humans and animals does not always coincide with the depth of our understanding of its pathogenesis. This information is best acquired by reading each of the ensuing chapters on specific bacterial diseases, infectious disease texts, and public health bulletins."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A537","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch7","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A537","book":"mmed","sec":"A545","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A537","book":"mmed","sec":"A547","value":"Host Susceptibility"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A537","book":"mmed","sec":"A549","value":"Pathogenic Mechanisms"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A537","book":"mmed","sec":"A560","value":"Specific Virulence Factors"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A537","book":"mmed","sec":"A567","value":"Biologic Activity of Endotoxin"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A537","book":"mmed","sec":"A573","value":"Detection of Endotoxin in Medical Solutions"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A537","book":"mmed","sec":"A577","value":"Epilogue"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A537","book":"mmed","sec":"A578","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413346","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

The most important level of this type of classification is the species level. A species name should mean the same thing to everyone. Within one species, strains and subgroups can differ by the disease they produce, their environmental habitat, and many other characteristics. Formerly, species were created on the basis of such criteria, which may be extremely important for clinical microbiologists and physicians but which are not a sufficient basis for establishing a species. Verification of existing species and creation of new species should involve biochemical and other phenotypic criteria as well as DNA relatedness. In numerical or phenetic approaches to classification, strains are grouped on the basis of a large number of phenotypic characteristics. DNA relatedness is used to group strains on the basis of overall genetic similarity. Species are identified in the clinical laboratory by morphological traits and biochemical tests, some of which are supplemented by serologic assessments (e.g., identification of Salmonella and Shigella species). Because of differences in pathogenicity (Escherichia coli) or the necessity to characterize a disease outbreak (Vibrio cholerae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), strains of medical interest are often classified below the species level by serology or identification of toxins. Pathogenic or epidemic strains also can be classified by the presence of a specific plasmid, by their plasmid profile (the number and sizes of plasmids), or by bacteriophage susceptibility patterns (phage typing). Newer molecular biologic techniques have enabled scientists to identify some species and strains (without the use of biochemical tests) by identifying a specific gene or genetic sequence, sometimes directly from the clinical specimen. Laboratories have no difficulty in identifying typical strains of common bacteria using commonly available test systems. Problems do arise, however, when atypical strains or rare or newly described species are not in the data base. Such difficulties are compounded when the strains are misidentified rather than unidentified, and so laboratory personnel and physicians (at least infectious diseases specialists) should be familiar with taxonomic reference texts and journals that publish papers on new species. Bacterial nomenclature at the genus and species level changes often, based primarily on the use of newer genetic techniques. A species may acquire more than one name. In some cases the recognition of a new species results in a unique correlation with specific clinical problems. For example, recognition of Porphyromonas gingivalis as a unique species, separate from its previous inclusion within Bacteroides melaninogenicus (now known to be composed of several taxonomic groups of black-pigmenting anaerobic gram-negative bacilli), elucidated its role as a key pathogen in adult periodontitis. It is important to understand why these changes and synonyms exist in taxonomy. The clinical laboratory is concerned with the rapid, sensitive, and accurate identification of microbes involved in producing disease. The number and types of tests done in such a laboratory depend on its size and the population it serves. Highly specialized or rarely performed tests should be done only by reference laboratories. Physicians, clinical laboratory personnel, and reference laboratory personnel must have a good working relationship if patients are to receive first-rate care. In addition, the physician and the clinical laboratory personnel must know which diseases and isolates are reportable to public health laboratories and how to report them ."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A319","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch3","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A319","book":"mmed","sec":"A327","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A319","book":"mmed","sec":"A328","value":"Definitions"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A319","book":"mmed","sec":"A334","value":"Approaches to Taxonomy"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A319","book":"mmed","sec":"A347","value":"Phenotypic Characteristics Useful in Classification and Identification"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A319","book":"mmed","sec":"A352","value":"Classification Below and Above the Species Level"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A319","book":"mmed","sec":"A355","value":"Designation of New Species and Nomenclatural Changes"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A319","book":"mmed","sec":"A356","value":"Assessing Newly Described Bacteria"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A319","book":"mmed","sec":"A357","value":"Role of the Clinical Laboratory"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A319","book":"mmed","sec":"A360","value":"Interfacing with Public Health Laboratories"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A319","book":"mmed","sec":"A362","value":"Hazards of Clinical Laboratory Work"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A319","book":"mmed","sec":"A367","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413329","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

Although immune and nonimmune (nonspecific) defenses operate together to control viral infections, this chapter considers only nonspecific defenses. Some nonspecific defenses exist independently of infection (e.g., genetic factors, anatomic barriers, nonspecific inhibitors in body fluids, and phagocytosis). Others (e.g., fever, inflammation, and interferon) are produced by the host in response to infection. All nonspecific defenses begin to act before the specific defense responses develop and can potentiate some of the established immune effector mechanisms. The fact that viruses replicate intracellularly and the ability of some viruses to spread by inducing cell fusion partly protect viruses against such extracellular defenses as neutralizing antibody, phagocytosis, and nonspecific inhibitors. However, because they replicate within the cell, viruses are vulnerable to intracellular alterations caused by host responses to infection. Nonspecific responses that alter the intracellular environment include fever, inflammation, and interferon. These multiple defenses function with great complexity because of their interactions with one another. This complexity is compounded by the varying effectiveness of the defenses that results from the diversity of viruses, hosts, and sites and stages of infection."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2668","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch49","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2668","book":"mmed","sec":"A2675","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2668","book":"mmed","sec":"A2676","value":"Defense Mechanisms that Precede Infection"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2668","book":"mmed","sec":"A2681","value":"Defense Mechanisms Evoked by Infection"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2668","book":"mmed","sec":"A2685","value":"Viral Interference and Interferon"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2668","book":"mmed","sec":"A2697","value":"Conclusion"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2668","book":"mmed","sec":"A2698","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413325","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

More than 50,000 species have been described, most of which are free-living organisms; protozoa are found in almost every possible habitat. The fossil record in the form of shells in sedimentary rocks shows that protozoa were present in the Pre-cambrian era. Anton van Leeuwenhoek was the first person to see protozoa, using microscopes he constructed with simple lenses. Between 1674 and 1716, he described, in addition to free-living protozoa, several parasitic species from animals, and Giardia lamblia from his own stools. Virtually all humans have protozoa living in or on their body at some time, and many persons are infected with one or more species throughout their life. Some species are considered commensals, i.e., normally not harmful, whereas others are pathogens and usually produce disease. Protozoan diseases range from very mild to life-threatening. Individuals whose defenses are able to control but not eliminate a parasitic infection become carriers and constitute a source of infection for others. In geographic areas of high prevalence, well-tolerated infections are often not treated to eradicate the parasite because eradication would lower the individual's immunity to the parasite and result in a high likelihood of reinfection. Many protozoan infections that are inapparent or mild in normal individuals can be life-threatening in immunosuppressed patients, particularly patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Evidence suggests that many healthy persons harbor low numbers of Pneumocystis carinii in their lungs. However, this parasite produces a frequently fatal pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients such as those with AIDS. Toxoplasma gondii, a very common protozoan parasite, usually causes a rather mild initial illness followed by a long-lasting latent infection. AIDS patients, however, can develop fatal toxoplasmic encephalitis. Cryptosporidium was described in the 19th century, but widespread human infection has only recently been recognized. Cryptosporidium is another protozoan that can produce serious complications in patients with AIDS. Microsporidiosis in humans was reported in only a few instances prior to the appearance of AIDS. It has now become a more common infection in AIDS patients. As more thorough studies of patients with AIDS are made, it is likely that other rare or unusual protozoan infections will be diagnosed. Acanthamoeba species are free-living amebas that inhabit soil and water. Cyst stages can be airborne. Serious eye-threatening corneal ulcers due to Acanthamoeba species are being reported in individuals who use contact lenses. The parasites presumably are transmitted in contaminated lens-cleaning solution. Amebas of the genus Naegleria, which inhabit bodies of fresh water, are responsible for almost all cases of the usually fatal disease primary amebic meningoencephalitis. The amebas are thought to enter the body from water that is splashed onto the upper nasal tract during swimming or diving. Human infections of this type were predicted before they were recognized and reported, based on laboratory studies of Acanthamoeba infections in cell cultures and in animals. The lack of effective vaccines, the paucity of reliable drugs, and other problems, including difficulties of vector control, prompted the World Health Organization to target six diseases for increased research and training. Three of these were protozoan infections—malaria, trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis. Although new information on these diseases has been gained, most of the problems with control persist."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4072","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch77","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4072","book":"mmed","sec":"A4079","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4072","book":"mmed","sec":"A4080","value":"Structure"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4072","book":"mmed","sec":"A4082","value":"Classification"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4072","book":"mmed","sec":"A4084","value":"Life Cycle Stages"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4072","book":"mmed","sec":"A4085","value":"Reproduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4072","book":"mmed","sec":"A4086","value":"Nutrition"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4072","book":"mmed","sec":"A4087","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413323","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

The helminths are invertebrates characterized by elongated, flat or round bodies. In medically oriented schemes the flatworms or platyhelminths (platy from the Greek root meaning “flat”) include flukes and tapeworms. Roundworms are nematodes (nemato from the Greek root meaning “thread”). These groups are subdivided for convenience according to the host organ in which they reside, e.g., lung flukes, extraintestinal tapeworms, and intestinal roundworms. This chapter deals with the structure and development of the three major groups of helminths. Helminths develop through egg, larval (juvenile), and adult stages. Table 86-1 gives the names applied to various larval helminths. Knowledge of the different stages in relation to their growth and development is the basis for understanding the epidemiology and pathogenesis of helminth diseases, as well as for the diagnosis and treatment of patients harboring these parasites. The contributions of various stages to disease are listed in Table 86-2. Platyhelminths and nematodes that infect humans have similar anatomic features that reflect common physiologic requirements and functions. The outer covering of helminths is the cuticle or tegument. Prominent external structures of flukes and cestodes are acetabula (suckers) or bothria (false suckers). Male nematodes of several species possess accessory sex organs that are external modifications of the cuticle. Internally, the alimentary, excretory, and reproductive systems can be identified by an experienced observer. Tapeworms are unique in lacking an alimentary canal. This lack means that nutrients must be absorbed through the tegument. The blood flukes and nematodes are bisexual. All other flukes and tapeworm species that infect humans are hermaphroditic. With few exceptions, adult flukes, cestodes, and nematodes produce eggs that are passed in excretions or secretions of the host. The various stages and their unique characteristics will be reviewed in more detail as each major group of helminths is considered."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4537","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch86","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4537","book":"mmed","sec":"A4541","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4537","book":"mmed","sec":"A4544","value":"Flukes (Trematodes)"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4537","book":"mmed","sec":"A4547","value":"Tapeworms (Cestodes)"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4537","book":"mmed","sec":"A4551","value":"Roundworms (Nematodes)"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4537","book":"mmed","sec":"A4555","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413320","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

In his classic address to the American Society of Parasitologists in 1946, entitled “This Wormy World,” Stoll estimated 2.3 billion helminthic infections in a human population of 2.2 billion. Since 1946, the world population has doubled and, by all indications, enteric nematode infections of humans have kept pace. The most common intestinal roundworms are those transmitted through contact with the soil (for example Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, the hookworms, and Strongyloides stercoralis). In Stoll's estimate, these worms, with Enterobius vermicularis, accounted for three-quarters of all helminthic infections. Most enteric nematodes have established a well-balanced host-parasite relationship with the human host; humans tolerate these parasites well. Little disease is associated with light infection, but when the worm load increases, a corresponding increase in disease usually occurs. The worms may irritate the intestinal mucosa, causing inflammation and ulceration. Some produce “toxic” substances. The larger worms may become entangled and block the intestinal tract. Larval worms that migrate through the tissue to complete their life cycle may lose their way, end up in the wrong organ, and cause severe disease. Nutritional problems occasionally are associated with the intestinal parasitosis, and persons with deficient diets often suffer from polyparasitism. Diagnosis usually is based on microscopic examination of feces for eggs and larvae, except in the case of pinworm infections, which are diagnosed by examining samples taken with perianal swab. Many antihelmintics are available to treat patients with these infections. Control depends largely on proper disposal of human feces and on personal hygiene. The enteric nematodes discussed in this chapter are A lumbricoides; the hookworms N americanus and A duodenale; S stercoralis; T trichiura; and E vermicularis."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4737","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch90","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4737","book":"mmed","sec":"A4783","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4737","book":"mmed","sec":"A4784","value":"Ascaris Lumbricoides"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4737","book":"mmed","sec":"A4794","value":"Hookworms"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4737","book":"mmed","sec":"A4804","value":"Strongyloides Stercoralis"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4737","book":"mmed","sec":"A4814","value":"Trichuris Trichura"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4737","book":"mmed","sec":"A4824","value":"Enterobius Vermicularis"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4737","book":"mmed","sec":"A4834","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413317","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

They are involved in a variety of human diseases, the most important of which are gas gangrene, tetanus, botulism, pseudomembranous colitis and food poisoning. In most cases, clostridia are opportunistic pathogens; that is, one or more species establishes a nidus of infection in a particular site in a compromised host. All pathogenic clostridial species produce protein exotoxins (such as botulinum and tetanus toxins) that play an important role in pathogenesis. Most generalizations about Clostridium have exceptions. The clostridia are classically anaerobic rods, but some species can become aerotolerant on subculture; a few species (C carnis, C histolyticum, and C tertium) can grow under aerobic conditions. Most species are Gram-positive, but a few are Gram-negative. Also, many Gram-positive species easily lose the Gram reaction, resulting in Gram-negative cultures. The clostridia form characteristic spores, the position of which is useful in species identification; however, some species do not sporulate unless exposed to exacting cultural conditions. Many clostridia are transient or permanent members of the normal flora of the human skin and the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals. Unlike typical members of the human bacterial flora, most clostridia can also be found worldwide in the soil. Because clostridia are ubiquitous saprophytes, many isolated from clinical specimens are accidental contaminants and not involved in a disease process. Because these organisms are normally found on the skin, even a pure culture of clostridia isolated from blood may have no clinical significance. In determining the importance of a clinical isolate of clostridia, the clinician should consider the frequency of isolation of the species, the presence of other microbes of pathogenic potential, and the clinical symptoms of the patient. Many clostridial infections can be controlled by antibiotic therapy (e.g., penicillin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, metronidazole) accompanied, in some cases, by tissue debridement. Antitoxin therapy and toxoid immunization are clearly useful in some clostridial infections, such as tetanus."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1050","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch18","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1050","book":"mmed","sec":"A1088","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1050","book":"mmed","sec":"A1089","value":"Gas Gangrene and Related Clostridial Wound Infections"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1050","book":"mmed","sec":"A1099","value":"Tetanus and Clostribium Tetani"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1050","book":"mmed","sec":"A1108","value":"Botulism and Clostridium Botulinum"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1050","book":"mmed","sec":"A1122","value":"Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea, Pseudomembranous Colitis, and Clostridium Difficile"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1050","book":"mmed","sec":"A1131","value":"Other Pathogenic Clostridia Food Poisoning and Clostridium perfringens"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A1050","book":"mmed","sec":"A1136","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413315","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

Pathogenic mechanisms include implantation of the virus at a body site (the portal of entry), replication at that site, and then spread to and multiplication within sites (target organs) where disease or shedding of virus into the environment occurs. Most viral infections are subclinical, suggesting that body defenses against viruses arrest most infections before disease symptoms become manifest. Knowledge of subclinical infections comes from serologic studies showing that sizeable portions of the population have specific antibodies to viruses even though the individuals have no history of disease. These inapparent infections have great epidemiologic importance: they constitute major sources for dissemination of virus through the population, and they confer immunity (see Ch. 48). Many factors affect pathogenic mechanisms. An early determinant is the extent to which body tissues and organs are accessible to the virus. Accessibility is influenced by physical barriers (such as mucus and tissue barriers), by the distance to be traversed within the body, and by natural defense mechanisms. If the virus reaches an organ, infection occurs only if cells capable of supporting virus replication are present. Cellular susceptibility requires a cell surface attachment site (receptor) for the virions and also an intracellular environment that permits virus replication and release. Even if virus initiates infection in a susceptible organ, replication of sufficient virus to cause disease may be prevented by host defenses (see Chs. 49 and 50). Other factors that determine whether infection and disease occur are the many virulence characteristics of the infecting virus. To cause disease, the infecting virus must be able to overcome the inhibitory effects of physical barriers, distance, host defenses, and differing cellular susceptibilities to infection. The inhibitory effects are genetically controlled and therefore may vary among individuals and races. Virulence characteristics enable the virus to initiate infection, spread in the body, and replicate to large enough numbers to impair the target organ. These factors include the ability to replicate under certain circumstances during inflammation, during the febrile response, in migratory cells, and in the presence of natural body inhibitors and interferon. Extremely virulent strains often occur within virus populations. Occasionally, these strains become dominant as a result of unusual selective pressures (see Ch. 48). The viral proteins and genes responsible for specific virulence functions are only just beginning to be identified. Fortunately for the survival of humans and animals (and hence for the infecting virus), most natural selective pressures favor the dominance of less virulent strains. Because these strains do not cause severe disease or death, their replication and transmission are not impaired by an incapacitated host. Mild or inapparent infections can result from absence of one or more virulence factors. For example, a virus that has all the virulence characteristics except the ability to multiply at elevated temperatures is arrested at the febrile stage of infection and causes a milder disease than its totally virulent counterpart. Live virus vaccines are composed of viruses deficient in one or more virulence factors; they cause only inapparent infections and yet are able to replicate sufficiently to induce immunity. The occurrence of spontaneous or induced mutations in viral genetic material may alter the pathogenesis of the induced disease, e.g. HIV. These mutations can be of particular importance with the development of drug resistant strains of virus. Disease does not always follow successful virus replication in the target organ. Disease occurs only if the virus replicates sufficiently to damage essential cells directly, to cause the release of toxic substances from infected tissues, to damage cellular genes or to damage organ function indirectly as a result of the host immune response to the presence of virus antigens. As a group, viruses use all conceivable portals of entry, mechanisms of spread, target organs, and sites of excretion. This abundance of possibilities is not surprising considering the astronomic numbers of viruses and their variants (see Ch. 43)."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2393","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch45","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2393","book":"mmed","sec":"A2404","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2393","book":"mmed","sec":"A2405","value":"Cellular Pathogenesis"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2393","book":"mmed","sec":"A2406","value":"Tissue Tropism"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2393","book":"mmed","sec":"A2407","value":"Sequence of Virus Spread in the Host"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2393","book":"mmed","sec":"A2413","value":"Dissemination from the Portal of Entry"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2393","book":"mmed","sec":"A2419","value":"Incubation Period"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2393","book":"mmed","sec":"A2420","value":"Multiplication in Target Organs"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2393","book":"mmed","sec":"A2421","value":"Shedding of Virus"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2393","book":"mmed","sec":"A2422","value":"Congenital Infections"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2393","book":"mmed","sec":"A2423","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413306","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

Genital infections due to the fungus Candida albicans or to members of the endogenous bacterial flora (Bacteroides fragilis and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae) are not known to be sexually transmitted. Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the balance of vaginal flora is upset. The urinary tract and urine are normally sterile.

Since they are widespread in nature and are often cultured from diseased body surfaces, it may be difficult to assess whether a fungus found during disease is a pathogen or a transient environmental contaminant. Before a specific fungus can be confirmed as the cause of a disease, the same fungus must be isolated from serial specimens and fungal elements morphologically consistent with the isolate must be observed in tissues taken from the lesion. In general, fungal infections and the diseases they cause are accidental. A few fungi have developed a commensal relationship with humans and are part of the indigenous microbial flora (e.g., various species of Candida, especially Candida albicans, and Malassezia furfur). Although a great deal of information is available concerning the molecular basis of bacterial pathogenesis, little is known about mechanisms of fungal pathogenesis. Infection is defined as entry into body tissues followed by multiplication of the organism. The infection may be clinically inapparent or may result in disease due to a cellular injury from competitive metabolism, elaboration of toxic metabolites, replication of the fungus, or an immune response. Immune responses may be transient or prolonged and may be cell-mediated, humoral (with production of specific antibody to components of the infecting organism), or both. Successful infection may result in disease, defined as a deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of body parts, organs, or systems (or combinations thereof) that is marked by a characteristic set of symptoms and signs and whose etiology, pathology, and prognosis are known or unknown."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3966","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch74","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3966","book":"mmed","sec":"A3972","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3966","book":"mmed","sec":"A3973","value":"Entry"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3966","book":"mmed","sec":"A3975","value":"Adaptation and Propagation"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3966","book":"mmed","sec":"A3976","value":"Dissemination"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3966","book":"mmed","sec":"A3977","value":"Host Factors"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3966","book":"mmed","sec":"A3978","value":"Fungal Factors"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3966","book":"mmed","sec":"A3983","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413297","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

The molds, for example, are a large group of microscopic fungi that include many of the economically important plant parasites, allergenic species, and opportunistic pathogens of humans and other animals. They are characterized by filamentous, vegetative cells called hyphae. A mass of hyphae forms the thallus (vegetative body) of the fungus, composed of mycelium. The more phylogenetically primitive molds (e.g., water molds, bread molds, and other sporangial—saclike—forms) produce cenocytic filaments (multinucleate cells without cross-walls), while the more advanced forms produce hyphae with cross-walls (septa) that subdivide the filament into uninucleate and multinucleate compartments. The septum, however, still provides for cytoplasmic communication, including intercellular migration of nuclei. Many fungi occur not as hyphae but as unicellular forms called yeasts, which reproduce vegetatively by budding. Some of the opportunistic fungal pathogens of humans are dimorphic, growing as a mycelium in nature and as a vegetatively reproducing yeast in the body. Candida is an example of such a dimorphic fungus (Fig. 73-1). It can undergo rapid transformation from the yeast to the hyphal phase in vivo, which partly contributes to its success in invading host tissue. The true fungi obtain their carbon compounds from nonliving organic substrates (saprophytes) or living organic material (parasites) by absorption of nutrients through their cell wall. Small molecules (e.g., simple sugars and amino acids) accumulate in a watery film surrounding the hyphae or yeast and simply diffuse through the cell wall. Macromolecules and insoluble polymers (e.g., proteins, glycogen, starch, and cellulose), on the other hand, must undergo preliminary digestion before they can be absorbed by the fungal cell. This process involves release of specific proteolytic, glycolytic, or lipolytic enzymes from the hypha or yeast, extracellular breakdown of the substrate(s), and diffusion of the products of digestion through the fungal cell envelope (Fig. 73-2). Fungal pathogens rely on these digestive enzymes to penetrate natural host barriers."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3939","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch73","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3939","book":"mmed","sec":"A3946","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3939","book":"mmed","sec":"A3949","value":"Cell Walls"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3939","book":"mmed","sec":"A3950","value":"Filamentous Fungi and Filamentous Bacteria"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3939","book":"mmed","sec":"A3952","value":"Hyphal and Yeast Morphogenesis"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3939","book":"mmed","sec":"A3955","value":"Reproduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3939","book":"mmed","sec":"A3959","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413296","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

A limited number of species, including E coli, K pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, S marcescens,and P mirabilis, are responsible for most infections produced by this group of organisms. The increasing incidence of the coliforms, Proteus, and other Gram-negative organisms in diseases reflects in part a better understanding of their pathogenic potential but more importantly the changing ecology of bacterial disease.

Few, if any, of these diseases are curable. Although some are genetically determined, most occur sporadically, and a history of the disease does not appear in close relatives. Therefore, it was surprising to discover that several of these chronic idiopathic disorders of humans, i.e., kuru (a heredofamilial disease restricted in distribution to the Eastern Highlands of Papua, New guinea), the sporadic and familial types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a presenile dementia with worldwide distribution), and the Gerstmann-Straussler-Schenker syndrome, were caused by infectious agents. In humans, kuru and the transmissible viral dementias are in a group of slow infections termed subacute spongiform virus encephalopathies because of their strikingly similiar histopathologic lesions (Table 71-1). In animals, scrapie of sheep and goats, transmissible mink encephalopathy, and the chronic wasting disease of captive mule deer, elk, and zoo ungulates have similar histopathology, pathogenesis, and properties of their infectious agents. They all belong to the same group of atypical diseases caused by unconventional viruses (prions). We are at a challenging time in the study of the subacute spongiform encephalopathies and the unconventional viruses that cause them. The monomer of the scrapie-altered form of the normal scrapie precursor protein (PrP33-35) and its cleavage product, the scrapie amyloid protein (PrP27–30) (Figs. 71-1 and 71-2), seems to be the infectious agent directing its own synthesis by autonucleation and autopatterning of configurational change in the normal host precursor protein. Polymerization of fibril crystallization of this infectious scrapie amyloid monomer (PrP27–30) forms the scrapie-associated fibrils and scrapie-kuru-Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease-Gerstmann-Straussler-Schenker syndrome plaques. Future physicochemical studies should resolve the details of the process of configurational change by which a normal host protein is changed to the infectious self-inducing, insoluble, protease-resistant amyloid-like infectious virus. This chapter is devoted to the four slow infections of the human nervous system (kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Schenker syndrome, and Fatal Familial Insomnia) and one of animals, scrapie, the prototype infection of the spongiform encephalopathies."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3778","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch71","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3778","book":"mmed","sec":"A3793","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3778","book":"mmed","sec":"A3797","value":"Unconventional Viruses"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3778","book":"mmed","sec":"A3805","value":"Scrapie"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3778","book":"mmed","sec":"A3808","value":"Kuru"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3778","book":"mmed","sec":"A3812","value":"Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3778","book":"mmed","sec":"A3823","value":"Concluding Comments"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3778","book":"mmed","sec":"A3824","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413288","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

They represent a rather diverse collection of bacteria, and therefore listing characteristics that apply to the entire group is difficult. The common threads that hold the rickettsiae into a group are their epidemiology, their obligate intracellular lifestyle, and the laboratory technology required to work with them. In the laboratory, rickettsiae cannot be cultivated on agar plates or in broth, but only in viable eukaryotic host cells (e.g., in cell culture, embryonated eggs, or susceptible animals). The exception, which shows the artificial nature of using obligate intracellular parasitism as a defining phenotypic characteristic, is Bartonella (Rochalimaea) quintana, which is cultivable axenically, but was traditionally considered as a rickettsia. The diversity of rickettsiae is demonstrated in the variety of specific intracellular locations where they live and the remarkable differences in their major outer membrane proteins and genetic relatedness (Table 38-1). An example of extreme adaptation is that the metabolic activity of Coxiella burnetii is greatly increased in the acidic environment of the phagolysosome, which is a harsh location for survival for most other organisms. Obligate intracellular parasitism among bacteria is not unique to rickettsiae. Chlamydiae also have evolved to occupy an intracellular niche, and numerous bacteria (e.g., Mycobacteria, Legionella, Salmonella, Shigella, Francisella, and Brucella) are facultative intracellular parasites. In contrast with chlamydiae, all rickettsiae can synthesize ATP. Coxiella burnetii is the only rickettsia that appears to have a developmental cycle. Some organisms in the family Rickettsiaceae are closely related genetically (e.g., Rickettsia rickettsii, R akari, R prowazekii, and R typhi); others are related less closely to Rickettsia species (e.g., Ehrlichia and Bartonella); and others not related to Rickettsia species (e.g., C burnetii). The phenotypic traits of the medically important organism Orientia (Rickettsia) tsutsugamushi suggest that the species may be an example of convergent evolution in a similar ecologic niche. Rickettsioses are zoonoses that, except for Q fever, are usually transmitted to humans by arthropods (tick, mite, flea, louse, or chigger) (Table 38-2). Therefore, their geographic distribution is determined by that of the infected arthropod, which for most rickettsial species is the reservoir host. Rickettsiae are important causes of human diseases in the United States (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Q fever, murine typhus, sylvatic typhus, human monocytic ehrlichiosis, human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, and rickettsialpox) and around the world (Q fever, murine typhus, scrub typhus, epidemic typhus, boutonneuse fever, and other spotted fevers) (Table 38-2)."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2078","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch38","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2078","book":"mmed","sec":"A2104","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2078","book":"mmed","sec":"A2107","value":"Rickettsiae of the Spotted Fever and Typhus Groups"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2078","book":"mmed","sec":"A2122","value":"Orientia (Rickettsia) tsutsugamushi and Scrub Typhus"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2078","book":"mmed","sec":"A2129","value":"Ehrlichia"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2078","book":"mmed","sec":"A2130","value":"Coxiella burnetii and Q Fever"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2078","book":"mmed","sec":"A2138","value":"Bartonella"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A2078","book":"mmed","sec":"A2139","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413251","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

Various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. Among the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. Streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. The nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. For several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: S pyogenes (group A streptococci) and S pneumoniae (pneumococci). In 1984, two members were assigned a new genus - the group D enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became Enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and E faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). In recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. A variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. Some of the other medically important streptococci are S agalactiae (group B), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease; E faecalis (group D), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. Particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. Important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include S mutans and S sanguis (involved in dental caries), S mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and “S milleri” (associated with suppurative infections in children and adults). There remains persistent taxonomic confusion regarding “S milleri.” These and other streptococci of medical importance are listed inTable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A800","book":"mmed","sec":"mmed_ch13","value":"General Concepts"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A800","book":"mmed","sec":"A819","value":"Introduction"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A800","book":"mmed","sec":"A821","value":"Clinical Manifestations"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A800","book":"mmed","sec":"A824","value":"Classification, Antigenic Types and Extracellular Growth Products"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A800","book":"mmed","sec":"A828","value":"Pathogenesis"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A800","book":"mmed","sec":"A837","value":"Host Defenses"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A800","book":"mmed","sec":"A838","value":"Epidemiology"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A800","book":"mmed","sec":"A839","value":"Diagnosis"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A800","book":"mmed","sec":"A847","value":"Control"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A800","book":"mmed","sec":"A850","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21413248","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

During development, liver size increases with increasing age, averaging 5 cm span at 5 years and attaining adult size by age 15. The size depends on several factors: age, sex, body size and shape, as well as the particular examination technique utilized (e.g., palpation versus percussion versus radiographic). By percussion, the mean liver size is 7 cm for women and 10.5 cm for men (Table 94.1). A liver span 2 to 3 cm larger or smaller than these values is considered abnormal. The liver weighs 1200 to 1400 g in the adult woman and 1400 to 1500 g in the adult man. Most if not all of the normal liver is concealed by the right rib cage and is beyond the feel of the examiner's hand (Figures 94.1, 94.2). The normal liver is smooth, with no irregularities. When the liver can be felt, it is usually due to: (1) increased diaphragmatic descent; (2) presence of a palpable caudate or Riedel's lobe; (3) presence of emphysema with an associated depressed diaphragm; (4) thin body habitus with narrow thoracic cage; (5) fatty infiltration (enlarged with rounded edge); (6) active hepatitis (enlarged and tender); (7) cirrhosis (enlarged with nodular irregularity); or (8) hepatic neoplasm (enlarged with rock-hard or nodular consistency)."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3049","book":"cm","sec":"A3050","value":"Definition"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3049","book":"cm","sec":"A3054","value":"Technique"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3049","book":"cm","sec":"A3056","value":"Basic Science"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3049","book":"cm","sec":"A3057","value":"Clinical Significance"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3049","book":"cm","sec":"A3059","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21250261","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

The clinician's duty is to discover and treat the source of the pain as well as to treat the pain itself. In patients with sensory perversions, the sensory system is disordered; sensations may be diminished, increased, or distorted. Diminution or loss of pain sensation is termed hypoalgesia or analgesia. Hyperpathia indicates a lowered threshold for painful sensation. Stimuli that are usually nonpainful can cause pain (e.g., sunburn). Nervous system damage is characteristic in this condition.

Listen to the cadence and sounds of the gait: the stamp of sensory ataxia; the short, festinating shuffle of the patient with parkinsonism; the alternating scuffling of a hemiparetic leg. Observation continues when the patient enters the door. Posture, gait, and stature are noted as the patient walks to the chair. Coordination of the extremities and fine movements of the hands are watched as the patient approaches the examiner, shakes hands, and sits. Observe the patient's hygiene carefully: appropriateness of dress, cleanliness of clothes and body, fastidiousness or lack of it. Odors can give important clinical information; uremia and ketosis are two obvious examples. Speech, language, and various aspects of the mental status can be assessed as conversation begins and continues. Emotional appropriateness and spontaneous speech are perhaps assessed better at this time than on formal testing later. Abnormal postures such as head tilt and titubation are visible. Involuntary movements such as twitches, facial synkinesia, and chorea may be obvious during this initial phase. This is the time consciously to form a general impression of the patient: status; general appearance; wasting; kyphosis; scoliosis; and systemic signs of disease (e.g., hyperthyroidism, myxedema, cachexia). A considerable amount of information about cranial nerve function can be gained by inspection during the taking of the history: Field deficits may be obvious in the way the patient keeps the fovea centered on a moving examiner; fullness of eye movements; facial movements; unsynchronized blink or facial synkinesias of patients with previous Bell's palsy; the characteristic head movements of a patient who is deaf in one ear; dysarthria; swallowing problems; sternocleidomastoid weakness, atrophy, or spasm. Mild weakness of one extremity or hemiparesis is often best discerned by watching the unconscious movements of the patient as he or she picks at the clothes, fusses with hair, etc. The examples given above just begin to scratch the surface of the information potentially available to the discerning observer. The information is given unwittingly by the patient, bereft of conscious motivation.

Slowing of the pulse rate (bradycardia) may be seen in heart block, hypothyroidism, or with the use of certain drugs (e.g., propranolol). Irregularities in the pulse suggest the presence of premature beats, and a completely irregular pulse implies the presence of atrial fibrillation. Diminished or absent pulses in the various arteries examined may be indicative of impaired blood flow due to a variety of conditions. Bruits are rushing sounds heard over large and medium-sized arteries as a result of vibration in the vessel wall caused by turbulent blood flow. The sound may originate from a local narrowing or dilation of the vessel itself, or it may be transmitted along the artery from a more proximal lesion in the vascular system. The intensity and duration of the bruit relate to the degree of vessel wall distortion. In general, bruits are not audible until an artery is approximately 50% occluded.

The truth of the first two premises is fairly easily demonstrated, but the third is more difficult to prove. Certainly, most practicing physicians can testify to the occasional dramatic detection of an asymptomatic abdominal mass or a small coin lesion seen on chest x-ray that resulted in the discovery and removal of an early-stage carcinoma. Such testimonials initially supported the growing enthusiasm for periodic examination of well adults, despite the lack of scientific proof of the benefit of such activities. Furthermore, success with immunization against common communicable diseases as well as public sanitation programs suggested that prevention was beneficial. Nevertheless, the transfer of this benefit to other major health problems, particularly problems or disease related to health habits and lifestyle, has yet to be demonstrated, especially when performed in the aggregate, as represented by the periodic health examination. One prospective, controlled study of annual examinations was unable to demonstrate lowered mortality, decreased outpatient clinic use or hospitalization rates in a comprehensively screened population as compared to a control group. Despite this lack of demonstrable benefit, by the early 1970s a well-adult examination was one of the most common reasons for an office visit with a physician, and these yearly visits frequently resulted in the performance of laboratory tests and x-rays. These examinations have been largely focused on what may be called secondary prevention: the detection of asymptomatic disease in apparently healthy subjects. In addition to detecting disease, well-adult examinations have been thought to be beneficial by relieving the fears of those concerned about occult disease (i.e., reassurance of the \"worried well\"), by promoting the doctor–patient relationship, and by providing a \"baseline\" for future problem solving."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A6511","book":"cm","sec":"A6512","value":"The Modern Era of Periodic Well-Adult Examinations"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A6511","book":"cm","sec":"A6515","value":"Current Recommendations"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A6511","book":"cm","sec":"A6526","value":"What Is Actually Performed"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A6511","book":"cm","sec":"A6527","value":"Conclusion"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A6511","book":"cm","sec":"A6528","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21250178","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

An allergic drug reaction is one involving the special biochemical mechanisms involved in immunologic amplification. Fewer than 15% of all ADRs are allergic in nature. The different types of ADRs are summarized in Table 214.1. Care must be exercised in defining an allergic reaction. In particular, an immunologic explanation for an untoward event cannot be accepted merely because other explanations are lacking. Even with such care, exact definition often remains difficult, because rechallenge with the suspected agent is usually unethical. Some features that support an allergic mechanism are as follows: The reaction takes a form associated with known immunologic mechanisms, e.g., rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis, serum sickness. The reaction cannot be explained on the basis of known pharmacologic or idiosyncratic effects of the drug(s). In the absence of prior exposure, the reaction occurs after 7 to 10 days on the drug. With prior sensitization, an anaphylactic reaction usually occurs within 30 minutes and other \"accelerated\" reactions within 2 to 4 days. Other features, such as eosinophilia and resolution on withdrawal of the drug, support the diagnosis.

Urea is the primary metabolite derived from dietary protein and tissue protein turnover. Creatinine is the product of muscle creatine catabolism. Both are relatively small molecules (60 and 113 daltons, respectively) that distribute throughout total body water. In Europe, the whole urea molecule is assayed, whereas in the United States only the nitrogen component of urea (the blood or serum urea nitrogen, i.e., BUN or SUN) is measured. The BUN, then, is roughly one-half (28/60 or 0.446) of the blood urea. The normal range of urea nitrogen in blood or serum is 5 to 20 mg/dl, or 1.8 to 7.1 mmol urea per liter. The range is wide because of normal variations due to protein intake, endogenous protein catabolism, state of hydration, hepatic urea synthesis, and renal urea excretion. A BUN of 15 mg/dl would represent significantly impaired function for a woman in the thirtieth week of gestation. Her higher glomerular filtration rate (GFR), expanded extracellular fluid volume, and anabolism in the developing fetus contribute to her relatively low BUN of 5 to 7 mg/dl. In contrast, the rugged rancher who eats in excess of 125 g protein each day may have a normal BUN of 20 mg/dl. The normal serum creatinine (sCr) varies with the subject's body muscle mass and with the technique used to measure it. For the adult male, the normal range is 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dl, or 53 to 106 μmol/L by the kinetic or enzymatic method, and 0.8 to 1.5 mg/dl, or 70 to 133 μmol/L by the older manual Jaffé reaction.

The jugular venous pressure is usually assessed by observing the right side of the patient's neck. The normal mean jugular venous pressure, determined as the vertical distance above the midpoint of the right atrium, is 6 to 8 cm H2O. Deviations from this normal range reflect either hypovolemia (i.e., mean venous pressure less than 5 cm H2O) or impaired cardiac filling (i.e., mean venous pressure greater than 9 cm H2O). The normal jugular venous pulse contains three positive waves. By convention these are labeled \"a,\" \"c\", and \"v\" (Figure 19.1). These positive deflections occur, respectively, before the carotid upstroke and just after the P wave of the ECG (a wave); simultaneous with the upstroke of the carotid pulse (c wave); and during ventricular systole until the tricuspid valve opens (v wave). The a wave is generated by atrial contraction, which actively fills the right ventricle in end-diastole. The c wave is caused either by transmission of the carotid arterial impulse through the external and internal jugular veins or by the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium in early systole. The v wave reflects the passive increase in pressure and volume of the right atrium as it fills in late systole and early diastole. Normally the crests of the a and v waves are approximately equal in amplitude. The descents or troughs (Figure 19.1) of the jugular venous pulse occur between the \"a\" and \"c\" wave (\"x\" descent), between the \"c\" and \"v\" wave (\"x\" descent), and between the \"v\" and \"a\" wave (\"y\" descent). The x and x′ descents reflect movement of the lower portion of the right atrium toward the right ventricle during the final phases of ventricular systole. The y descent represents the abrupt termination of the downstroke of the v wave during early diastole after the tricuspid valve opens and the right ventricle begins to fill passively. Normally the y descent is neither as brisk nor as deep as the x descent. Abnormalities in the jugular venous pulse may be reflected in either the mean pressure, amplitude, or configuration of the positive waves or negative troughs, or in the sequence or absence of the positive waves. In this chapter emphasis is placed on measurement of the jugular venous pressure, use of the venous pulse to determine cardiac rhythm, and the more common cardiac problems of pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation, and constrictive pericarditis."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A622","book":"cm","sec":"A623","value":"Definition"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A622","book":"cm","sec":"A625","value":"Technique"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A622","book":"cm","sec":"A629","value":"Basic Science"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A622","book":"cm","sec":"A630","value":"Clinical Significance"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A622","book":"cm","sec":"A639","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21250143","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

Although usually heard with the stethoscope, such sounds may occasionally also be palpated as a thrill. In the head and neck, these auscultatory sounds may originate in the heart (cardiac valvular murmurs radiating to the neck), the cervical arteries (carotid artery bruits), the cervical veins (cervical venous hum), or arteriovenous (AV) connections (intracranial AV malformations). These sounds may be normal, innocent findings (i.e., a venous hum in a child) or may point to underlying pathology (i.e., a carotid artery bruit caused by atherosclerotic stenosis in an adult). Head and neck bruits loom especially important today because physicians encounter arterial occlusive disease more frequently as a greater proportion of our population lives longer. What are the clinical circumstances where head and neck auscultation is indicated? Evaluation often begins with patient symptoms related to cardiovascular or neurologic disease. This involves a through, directed physical examination following pertinent historical information. Second, the necessity for head and neck auscultation may be part of repeated or sequential physical examinations directed by new data from subsequent history, physical examination, or laboratory information obtained later in the hospital course. Finally, auscultation of head and neck vascular sounds may be part of a routine, complete (comprehensive) physical examination, especially in subsets of patients at risk for neurologic or cardiovascular disease. Cranial and orbital bruits are vibrations resulting from turbulence in intracranial or extracranial vessels. Although usually systolic in timing, these bruits may extend into diastole or even be continuous. These sounds may originate within the cranium or be transmitted from arteries in the neck or, occasionally, from cardiac valvular lesions. The orbits provide relative \"windows\" for transmission of intracranial sounds, with minimal bony dissipation. Indication for cranial and orbital auscultation usually follows from historical physical examination or laboratory evidence of cranial—cervical disorders such as seizures, headaches, stroke syndromes, intracranial mass lesions, or carotid bruits. Neck auscultation is commonly indicated for initial evaluation of stenotic or embolic cerebrovascular symptoms, or as part of a comprehensive physical examination in asymptomatic patients at risk for atherosclerosis. Cervical bruits and hums may arise from neck arteries or veins, and may be innocuous findings or indicate underlying pathology. Bruits arising in the carotid arteries are produced by intrinsic stenosis or, occasionally, with vascular occlusion from extrinsic compression. Depending on a variety of factors, these bruits may be systolic, primarily systolic with extension into diastole, or continuous. The cervical venous hum is auscultated over the internal jugular veins in many normal children. Commonly a continuous high-pitched sound, it is occasionally more prominent in diastole. It occurs more frequently on the right than on the left, and may be present bilaterally. Supraclavicular bruits during systole are a frequent finding in normal children and in adults with subclavian or vertebral artery stenosis. Supraclavicular auscultation is usually initiated to evaluate vertebral artery occlusive symptoms, arm claudication, or \"subclavian steal\" in the adult with atherosclerosis."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A593","book":"cm","sec":"A594","value":"Definition"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A593","book":"cm","sec":"A595","value":"Technique"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A593","book":"cm","sec":"A599","value":"Basic Science"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A593","book":"cm","sec":"A602","value":"Clinical Significance"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A593","book":"cm","sec":"A608","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21250132","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

Reticulocytes thus represent a distinctive cohort of cells, those most recently entering the peripheral blood. Reticulocytes differ from other red cells in that they have a more convoluted shape, and are about 8% larger than the more mature cells. These latter two distinctions are not so clear-cut as is the presence of residual RNA. With the typical Wright's stain used for routine examination, only the earliest reticulocytes with the most residual RNA will be \"polychromatophil\" (i.e., more bluish than the mature erythrocytes)."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4597","book":"cm","sec":"A4598","value":"Definition"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4597","book":"cm","sec":"A4599","value":"Technique"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4597","book":"cm","sec":"A4600","value":"Basic Science"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4597","book":"cm","sec":"A4602","value":"Clinical Significance"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4597","book":"cm","sec":"A4605","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21250107","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

Historically, attempts have been made to classify humans into discrete somatotypes (mesomorphic—muscular and athletic; endomorphic—rounded and stout; and ectomorphic—tall and thin), and to relate habitus to propensity to disease (e.g., habitus apoplectus). These terms have little clinical relevance today, and body size and habitus can be said to encompass the more quantifiable measurements of height, weight, body proportions, skinfold thickness, and mid–upper arm circumference. These measurements do not have true normal or abnormal values, but must be interpreted in the context of an individual's age, sex, clinical status, and previous measurements. The values can be plotted as a percentile of a reference population or as a percentage of an \"ideal\" value. Height is the length from the plantar surface of the foot to the crown of the head. Heights that fall below the 3rd percentile or above the 97th percentile may require investigation. Weight is the total weight of the body. Weights greater than 120% of \"ideal\" suggest obesity, while weights less than 70% of \"ideal\" may indicate severe malnutrition. Body proportions include the trunk to limb ratio and the arm span. The trunk, or \"upper segment,\" is represented by the distance from the symphysis pubis to the crown of the head. The \"lower segment\" is the distance from the symphysis pubis to the plantar surface of the foot and represents the \"limb\" contribution to total height. At birth the normal upper to lower segment ratio is 1.7:1. The legs grow more rapidly than the trunk, and by age 10 the segments are equal and remain so in adults. The arm span is the distance between the tips of the middle fingers with the arms fully extended. In adults the arm span should equal the height. Mid–upper arm measurements are taken at the midpoint between the acromial process and the olecranon process. Skinfold thickness at this site is a measure of subcutaneous fat and is used to estimate total adiposity. Obesity is indicated by a value greater than 23 mm in men and 30 mm in women. Severe depletion of energy stores is indicated by values below the 30th percentile. Mid–upper arm circumference is used to calculate mid—upper arm muscle circumference. Muscle circumferences less than the 30th percentile suggest severe depletion of protein stores."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4022","book":"cm","sec":"A4023","value":"Definition"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4022","book":"cm","sec":"A4024","value":"Technique"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4022","book":"cm","sec":"A4025","value":"Basic Science"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4022","book":"cm","sec":"A4037","value":"Clinical Significance"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4022","book":"cm","sec":"A4042","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21250087","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

The classification given here (Table 136.1) is based on etiologic differences between these disorders rather than the formerly used phenomenologic classification. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or type I diabetes, formerly called juvenile-onset diabetes, is characterized by absolute dependency on exogenous insulin. About 10% of all people with diabetes have this type. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or type II diabetes, formerly referred to as adult-onset, maturity-onset, is characterized by gradual onset and hyperglycemia but no tendency to ketoacidosis except under extraordinary stress. People with NIDDM may take insulin to control hyperglycemia, but it is not absolutely required. About 60 to 70% of people with NIDDM are obese, and this type is sometimes subdivided into obese and nonobese categories. Eighty-five to 90% of all people with diabetes have this type. Maturity-onset diabetes in the young (MODY) differs from NIDDM in that is has a clearly defined autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The hyperglycemia in this type is generally quite mild. MODY is also characterized by a decreased frequency of the long-term complications of diabetes. Diabetes due to abnormalities in the amino acid sequence of insulin or abnormalities in cleavage from proinsulin causing decreased insulin action have been referred to as insulinopathies, in a manner analogous to the hemoglobinopathies. The prevalence of these abnormalities has not been established. At least three types of diabetes have been found in association with the dermatologic disorder acanthosis nigricans. These three types are associated with severe resistance to the action of insulin due to an abnormal insulin receptor (type A), antibodies to the insulin receptor (type B) or post-receptor abnormalities (type C). A number of congenital syndromes are associated with abnormal glucose tolerance, but the mechanisms responsible for the disordered carbohydrate metabolism are mostly unknown. Diabetes may be secondary, as a result of direct ablation of the beta cells in association with pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, or hemochromatosis. A separate category has been designated as gestational diabetes and refers to women whose diabetes first becomes manifest during pregnancy. Although the diabetes normally resolves upon delivery, over the following years over 50% of such women subsequently relapse into overt NIDDM. The criteria for the varying degrees of impairment in glucose tolerance are given in Table 136.2. These criteria are used for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but not for the type of diabetes. Three types of acute complications generally occur: severe hyperglycemia associated with a hyperosmolar, non-ketotic state; severe hperglycemia associated with ketoacidosis; and hypoglycemia. The chronic complications are generally classified into vascular and nonvascular. Macrovascular complications are caused by large vessel disease and the complications relate to the vascular system involved (e.g., cerebrovascular, coronary artery, and peripheral vascular disease). Microvascular complications are caused by small vessel disease and include retinopathy, renal glomerular disease (Kimmelstiel-Wilson disease), some of the neuropathies (mononeuropathies), and possibly cardiac and other small vessels. Non-vascular complications include cataracts and polyneuropathy, both peripheral and autonomic."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4003","book":"cm","sec":"A4004","value":"Definition"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4003","book":"cm","sec":"A4007","value":"Technique"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4003","book":"cm","sec":"A4008","value":"Basic Science"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4003","book":"cm","sec":"A4009","value":"Clinical Significance"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A4003","book":"cm","sec":"A4010","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21250086","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

Abnormalities involving the skin, cartilage, bone, and eardrum may interfere with hearing. The Rinne and Weber tuning-fork tests can be used in the office to evaluate hearing. With the Weber test, a tuning fork (usually 256 Hz) is activated and applied to the skull, the forehead, the chin, or the upper incisor teeth. A normal response is no lateralization of the sound energy generated from the fork to either ear. (It is perceived by the patient as being in the middle of the head or on top of the head.) In an abnormal patient, the vibrating fork will be perceived in the ear with conductive hearing loss (drum perforation, impacted wax, middle ear fluid, stapes fixation, or otosclerosis), provided the other ear is normal. If some sensorineural dysfunction exists in both ears, caused by aging deafness (presbycusis), ototoxicity from drugs, acoustic trauma from excess noise exposure, or following a central nervous system infection, a vibrating fork will be perceived in the ear with the best sensorineural function. In the Rinne test, when an activated tuning fork is held 2.5 cm from the ear and then placed on the mastoid process, a normal subject will hear it better (louder or more distinctly) in front of the ear than behind the ear. The proper notation is AC > BC; this indicates that air conduction is better than bone conduction. If the patient has abnormal hearing, a tuning fork activated and held 2.5 cm from the ear and then placed on the mastoid process will be heard better behind the ear. This result is written BC > AC (i.e., bone conduction is better than air conduction). Air conduction testing measures the integrity of the entire hearing apparatus from external ear to auditory cortex. Bone conduction testing measures the integrity of the sensorineural structures (cochlea, eighth nerve, brainstem nuclei, and relays to the auditory cortex). The combination of these two tests permits the examiner to use fundamental physiologic information in categorizing the patient's hearing as being within normal limits."},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3777","book":"cm","sec":"A3778","value":"Definition"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3777","book":"cm","sec":"A3779","value":"Technique"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3777","book":"cm","sec":"A3784","value":"Basic Science"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3777","book":"cm","sec":"A3785","value":"Clinical Significance"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"A3777","book":"cm","sec":"A3789","value":"References"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"21250075","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2011","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

The examiner must differentiate between itching, tearing, burning, foreign body sensation, photophobia, deep pain, pain on eye movement, or tenderness to touch.

The present study grew out of the desire of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) to convene significant stakeholders and researchers to determine what information can be gleaned from existing data and delineate the key research questions needed to address concerns regarding the effect of the changing health care system on the quality of care for individuals with chronic conditions, particularly chronic rheumatic diseases. Specifically, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) was charged with planning and conducting a workshop focused on the following questions: 1. Does the model of managed care or integrated delivery system (e.g., fully capitated managed care, gatekeeper-only model of managed care, discounted fee for service) influence (a) the types of interventions provided to patients with chronic conditions and (b) the clinical and health status outcomes of those interventions? 2. If so, are these effects quantitatively and clinically significant, as compared to the effects that other variables (such as income, education, or ethnicity) have on patient outcomes? 3. If the mode of health care delivery system appears to be related to patient care and outcomes, can specific organizational, financial, or other variables be identified to account for the relationships? 4.

Data were annualized when necessary to make results of different studies more comparable."},{"Label":"MAIN RESULTS","value":"Of over 400 citations identified, 126 appeared to meet screening criteria, and 35 met all criteria and were included in this review. While between 56% and 91% of chronic headache sufferers seek the care of a health care provider, only one-third report having received a diagnosis of their condition. While most patients with migraine consult a health care provider at some point, most do not continue to seek medical care. Relatively fewer patients with tension-type headache seek medical care. A small sub-population of chronic headache sufferers accounts for a high proportion of provider consultations, emergency department visits, and prescription drug claims. The vast majority of headache sufferers have used drugs to treat their headaches at some time. Non-prescription drugs are used more often than prescription drugs. Patients with more severe headache symptoms are both more likely to consult a health care provider about their headaches and more likely to use prescription medications. Use of prescription drugs for headache increases with age and is higher among women than men. About two-thirds of patients who try prescription medications do not continue to use them, citing the availability of effective non-prescription drugs, unwanted side-effects, and inadequate relief among the reasons for discontinuing prescription drug use. Rates of absenteeism due to headache of 2 to 4.3 days per year were reported in employee and community studies, while higher rates, ranging from 14.3 to 61 days per year, were observed in two studies conducted in clinical settings. These average figures obscure the fact that while many to most patients miss no days of work or school, a relatively small proportion of subjects accounts for many missed days. While headache does cause a large number of absences from work, it appears that many headache sufferers stay on the job, functioning with significantly reduced effectiveness, when they have a headache."},{"Label":"CONCLUSIONS","value":"Chronic headache sufferers represent a diverse population which is difficult to study. Population-based studies suggest that many headache sufferers do not seek medical care for their headaches and do not use prescription drugs to treat them. Studies conducted among headache patients in clinical settings suggest that these patients have more severe headache symptoms, use more prescriptions drugs, and are heavier users of medical resources. Data from both types of studies must be considered if the comprehensive cost of chronic headache is to be estimated."}]},"Language":"eng","Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"summary","book":"techrev2v1","value":"Summary"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"technicalreview","book":"techrev2v1","value":"Technical Review"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"references.rl1","book":"techrev2v1","value":"References"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"appendixes.app5","book":"techrev2v1","value":"Evidence Tables"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"appendixes.app1","book":"techrev2v1","value":"Appendix A Original Electronic Search Strategy"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"appendixes.app2","book":"techrev2v1","value":"Appendix B Revised Electronic Search Strategy"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"appendixes.app3","book":"techrev2v1","value":"Appendix C List of Excluded Articles"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"appendixes.app4","book":"techrev2v1","value":"Appendix D Data Collection Form for Headache Cost Studies: Original Research"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"20734516","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"8","Year":"2010","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"8","Year":"2010","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"8","Year":"2010","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

Sympathetic paragangliomas hypersecrete catecholamines; parasympathetic paragangliomas are most often nonsecretory.

In contrast, sympathetic extra-adrenal paragangliomas are generally confined to the lower mediastinum, abdomen, and pelvis, and are typically secretory. Pheochromocytomas, which arise from the adrenal medulla, typically hypersecrete catecholamines. Symptoms of PGL/PCC result either from mass effects or catecholamine hypersecretion (e.g., sustained or paroxysmal elevations in blood pressure, headache, episodic profuse sweating, forceful palpitations, pallor, and apprehension or anxiety).

Mutations in MAX predispose to PCC; a subset of individuals with mutations in MAX will also develop PGL. KIF1B and EGLN1 (formerly known as PHD2) have been reported to be associated with hereditary PGL/PCC, but their clinical significance is still unclear. Molecular genetic testing for disease-causing variants in SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, and MAX is clinically available."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Treatment of manifestations: For secretory tumors including pheochromocytomas, antagonism of catecholamine excess with pharmacologic adrenergic receptor blockade followed by surgery.

Prevention of secondary complications: Early detection through surveillance and removal of tumors may prevent or minimize complications related to mass effects, catecholamine hypersecretion, and malignant transformation. Surveillance: Beginning at age ten years or at least ten years before the earliest age at diagnosis in the family, individuals at risk for hereditary PGL/PCC syndromes need to begin lifelong biochemical and clinical surveillance for signs and symptoms of PGL/PCC. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Hypoxia, cigarette smoking. Evaluation of relatives at risk: First-degree relatives (age ≥10 years) of an individual with a known SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, or MAX mutation should be offered molecular genetic testing to clarify their genetic status to improve diagnostic certainty and reduce the need for costly screening procedures in those who have not inherited the disease-causing mutation."},{"Label":"GENETIC COUNSELING","value":"The hereditary PGL/PCC syndromes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

Prolactinomas are imaged by MRI, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are detected by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, and pancreatic endocrine tumors are detected by endoscopic ultrasound. Molecular genetic testing of MEN1, the only gene in which mutations are known to cause MEN1 syndrome, detects MEN1 mutations in about 80%-90% of probands with familial MEN1 syndrome and in approximately 65% of simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence of MEN1 syndrome in the family)."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Treatment of manifestations: Hyperparathyroidism is treated with subtotal parathyroidectomy and cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue or total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue; recent studies suggest that long-acting release octreotide or calcimimetic could be also effective; prior to surgery, bone anti-resorptive agents are used to reduce hypercalcemia and limit bone resorption. Prolactinomas are treated with dopamine agonists (cabergoline is the drug of choice). Growth hormone-secreting tumors causing acromegaly are treated by transsphenoidal surgery; medical therapy for growth hormone-secreting tumors includes somatostatin analogs, octreotide, and lanreotide. ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors associated with Cushing syndrome are surgically removed; non-secreting pituitary adenomas are treated by transsphenoidal surgery. Proton pump inhibitors or H2-receptor blockers reduce gastric acid output caused by gastrinomas. Surgery is indicated for insulinoma and most other pancreatic tumors. Long-acting somatostatin analogs can control the secretory hyperfunction associated with carcinoid syndrome. Surgical removal of adrenocortical tumors that exceed 3.0 cm in diameter can prevent malignancy. Prevention of primary manifestations: Thymectomy may prevent thymic carcinoid in males, particularly in smokers. Prevention of secondary complications: Measure PTH and/or serum calcium to assess for hypoparathyroidism following subtotal or total parathyroidectomy. Measure urinary catecholamines prior to surgery to diagnose and treat a pheochromocytoma to avoid blood pressure peaks during surgery.

The most common auditory symptoms are simple unformed sounds including humming, buzzing, or ringing; less common forms are distortions (e.g., volume changes) or complex sounds (e.g., specific songs or voices). Ictal receptive aphasia consists of a sudden onset of inability to understand language in the absence of general confusion. Less commonly, other ictal symptoms may occur, including sensory symptoms (visual, olfactory, vertiginous, or cephalic), or motor, psychic, and autonomic symptoms. Most affected individuals have secondarily generalized seizures, usually accompanied by simple partial and complex partial seizures, with auditory symptoms as a major simple partial seizure manifestation. Some persons have seizures precipitated by sounds such as a ringing telephone. Age at onset ranges from four to 50 years but is usually in adolescence or early adulthood.

Occasionally pigmentary retinopathy and lipomatosis are observed."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"The clinical diagnosis of MERRF is based on the following four \"canonical\" features: myoclonus, generalized epilepsy, ataxia, and ragged red fibers (RRF) in the muscle biopsy. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene MT-TK encoding tRNALys is the gene most commonly associated with MERRF. The most common mutation, present in over 80% of affected individuals with typical findings, is an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 8344 (m.8344A>G). Mutations are usually present in all tissues and are conveniently detected in mtDNA from blood leukocytes. However, the occurrence of \"heteroplasmy\" in disorders of mtDNA can result in varying tissue distribution of mutated mtDNA. Hence, in individuals having few symptoms consistent with MERRF or in asymptomatic maternal relatives of an affected individual, the pathogenic mutation may be undetectable in mtDNA from leukocytes and may only be detected in other tissues, such as cultured skin fibroblasts, urinary sediment, oral mucosa, hair follicles, or, most reliably, skeletal muscle."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Treatment of manifestations: conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizures; physical therapy to improve any impaired motor function; aerobic exercise; standard pharmacologic therapy for cardiac symptoms.

Classic Rett syndrome, a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting girls, is characterized by apparently normal psychomotor development during the first six to 18 months of life, followed by a short period of developmental stagnation, then rapid regression in language and motor skills, followed by long-term stability. During the phase of rapid regression, repetitive, stereotypic hand movements replace purposeful hand use. Additional findings include fits of screaming and inconsolable crying, autistic features, panic-like attacks, bruxism, episodic apnea and/or hyperpnea, gait ataxia and apraxia, tremors, seizures, and acquired microcephaly. Atypical Rett syndrome is observed increasingly as MECP2 mutations are identified in individuals previously diagnosed with: clinically suspected but molecularly unconfirmed Angelman syndrome; intellectual disability with spasticity or tremor; mild learning disability; or (rarely) autism.

Continuous intravenous epoprostenol (Flolan®), the most effective therapy to date, is standard for individuals with serious or life-threatening PAH; other approved medications include treprostinil (Remodulin®) subcutaneous, treprostinil (Remodulin®) intravenous, treprostinil inhalation (Tyvaso®), inhalation iloprost (Ventavis®), bosentan (Tracleer®), ambrisentan (Letairis®), sildenafil (Revatio®), and tadalafil (Adcirca®). A small minority of individuals respond well long term to oral calcium channel blockers. Chronic anticoagulation therapy, diuretics, and supplemental oxygen are used routinely as needed. No medical therapy has been demonstrated to reverse the proliferative vascular disease which is the anatomic origin of PAH, and the effect of any therapy on long term survival overall appears marginal. Lung transplantation is effective, but long-term survival is limited by chronic rejection. Agents/circumstances to avoid: appetite suppressants, such as fenfluramine/phentermine, dexfenfluramine, and amfepramone (diethylpropion); cocaine, amphetamines, and related compounds causing vasoconstriction; hypoxia (including that associated with high altitude); possibly estrogen compounds used as oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. Illicit drug use, especially methamphetamine, is an important cause of PAH in some regions. Testing of relatives at risk: Transthoracic echocardiographic screening of at-risk family members every few years is recommended to enable earlier detection and treatment. The value of early presymptomatic diagnosis of at-risk family members is generally accepted, but yet to be established. At-risk family members who do not have the mutation known to be present in their family do not need clinical screening.

Prevention of primary manifestations: If possible, high-dose radiotherapy should be avoided to reduce lifetime risk of developing late-onset secondary cancers. Surveillance: To detect retinoblastoma tumors in children at risk (i.e., those with: (1) an RB1 germline mutation [based either on molecular genetic testing or past history of bilateral or multifocal tumors], (2) unilateral retinoblastoma, (3) one or more retinomas, and/or (4) a positive family history but unknown mutation status), an eye examination every three to four weeks until age one year and then less frequently until age three years is recommended; young and/or uncooperative children usually require examination under anesthesia. To detect second non-ocular tumors in individuals with retinoblastoma, physicians and parents should promptly evaluate complaints of bone pain or lumps because of the high risk of sarcomas; however, no specific screening protocols exist. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Limiting exposures to DNA-damaging agents (radiotherapy, tobacco, and UV light) may reduce the excess cancer risks in hereditary retinoblastoma survivors.

In such instances, the risk to each sib of inheriting two HFE mutations is 50%. Risk to offspring: Offspring of an individual with HFE-HH inherit one mutant HFE allele from the affected parent. Because of the 1/9 chance that the other parent is a carrier for a mutant HFE allele, the risk to the offspring of inheriting two HFE mutations is approximately 5%. Prenatal testing: Although prenatal testing would be technically feasible for pregnancies at 25% or more risk, such requests would be highly unusual because HFE-HH is an adult-onset, treatable disorder with low clinical penetrance."}]},"Language":"eng","ContributionDate":{"Day":"03","Month":"04","Year":"2000"},"Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"hemochromatosis","book":"gene","sec":"hemochromatosis.Summary","value":"Summary"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"hemochromatosis","book":"gene","sec":"hemochromatosis.Diagnosis","value":"Diagnosis"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"hemochromatosis","book":"gene","sec":"hemochromatosis.Clinical_Description","value":"Clinical Description"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"hemochromatosis","book":"gene","sec":"hemochromatosis.Differential_Diagnosis","value":"Differential Diagnosis"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"hemochromatosis","book":"gene","sec":"hemochromatosis.Management","value":"Management"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"hemochromatosis","book":"gene","sec":"hemochromatosis.Genetic_Counseling","value":"Genetic Counseling"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"hemochromatosis","book":"gene","sec":"hemochromatosis.Molecular_Genetics","value":"Molecular Genetics"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"hemochromatosis","book":"gene","sec":"hemochromatosis.Resources","value":"Resources"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"hemochromatosis","book":"gene","sec":"hemochromatosis.References","value":"References"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"hemochromatosis","book":"gene","sec":"hemochromatosis.Chapter_Notes","value":"Chapter Notes"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"20301613","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2010","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2010","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2010","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

Because the risk of malignancy is low, however, removal of gonads is increasingly controversial. Additional treatment for CAIS may include vaginal dilatation to avoid dyspareunia. Treatment of PAIS in individuals with predominantly female genitalia is similar to treatment of CAIS, but is more likely to include prepubertal gonadectomy to help avoid increasing clitoromegaly at the time of puberty. In individuals with PAIS and ambiguous or predominantly male genitalia, the tendency has been for parents and healthcare professionals to assign sex of rearing after an expert evaluation has been completed. Those individuals with PAIS who are raised as males may undergo urologic surgery such as orchiopexy and hypospadias repair. Those individuals with PAIS who are raised as females and who undergo gonadectomy after puberty may need combined estrogen and androgen replacement therapy. Males with MAIS may require mammoplasty for gynecomastia. A trial of androgen pharmacotherapy may help improve virilization in infancy. It is best if the diagnosis of AIS is explained to the affected individual and family in an empathic environment, with both professional and family support.

Dactylitis (pain and/or swelling of the hands or feet) in infants and young children is often the earliest manifestation of sickle cell disease. In children the spleen can become engorged with blood cells in a “splenic sequestration crisis.” The spleen is also particularly subject to infarction and the majority of individuals with SCD are functionally asplenic in early childhood, increasing their risk for certain types of bacterial infections. Chronic hemolysis can result in varying degrees of anemia, jaundice, cholelithiasis, and delayed growth and sexual maturation.

Normal human hemoglobin is a heterotetramer composed of two α-hemoglobin chains and two β-hemoglobin chains. Hemoglobin S results from a point mutation in HBB, changing the sixth amino acid in the β-hemoglobin chain from glutamic acid to valine (Glu6Val). Sickle cell anemia (homozygous Hb SS) accounts for 60%-70% of sickle cell disease in the US. Other forms of sickle cell disease result from coinheritance of Hb S with other abnormal β-globin chain variants, the most common forms being sickle-hemoglobin C disease (Hb SC) and two types of sickle β-thalassemia (Hb Sβ+-thalassemia and Hb Sβ°-thalassemia); rarer forms result from coinheritance of other Hb variants such as D-Punjab and O-Arab. The diagnosis of sickle cell disease is established by demonstrating the presence of significant quantities of Hb S by isoelectric focusing (IEF), cellulose acetate electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or (less commonly) DNA analysis. Targeted mutation analysis is used to identify the common mutations of HBB associated with hemoglobin S, hemoglobin C, and additional rarer mutations. HBB sequence analysis may be used to detect mutations associated with β-thalassemia hemoglobin variants. Gel electrophoresis or HPLC can differentiate these disorders from heterozygous carriers of the Hb S mutation (Hb AS).

Pain episodes are additionally managed with a multi-model approach (e.g., warmth, massage, distraction, acupuncture, biofeedback, self-hypnosis). Aggressive pulmonary toilet and prompt evaluation and treatment of underlying infections are essential. Life-threatening or severe complications (e.g., acute chest syndrome and stroke) are often treated with transfusion to reduce the percentage of Hb S while increasing oxygen carrying capacity. Other treatments may include joint replacement, hemodialysis, kidney transplantation, splenectomy for splenic sequestration crisis, and/or cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis. Acute treatment of stroke includes red blood cell exchange transfusion and aggressive management of increased intracranial pressure and seizures. Severe priapism may require aspiration and irrigation. Management of pulmonary hypertension can include routine treatments and specific therapies such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors or nitric oxide. Prevention of primary manifestations: The mainstay is good hydration and avoidance of climate extremes, extreme fatigue, and activities leading to inflammation. Hydroxyurea can decrease the frequency and severity of vaso-occlusive processes, reduce transfusion needs, and increase life span. Chronic red blood cell transfusion is indicated in children with either a history of or risk factors for stroke and other specific complications, such as pulmonary hypertension and chronic renal failure. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive education on the management of fevers; prophylactic antibiotics, including penicillin in children; up-to-date immunizations; and iron chelation therapy for those with iron overload. Surveillance: Yearly: CBC and reticulocyte count, assessment of iron status, liver and renal function tests, and urinalysis. Yearly starting at age two to three years for all individuals with Hb SS and Hb Sβ°-thalassemia: transcranial Doppler studies of arterial blood flow velocity. Yearly starting at age seven years: chest x-ray, pulmonary function tests, abdominal ultrasound examination, eye examination, and vision screening.

Neonatal-onset disease manifests within hours to two days after birth. Childhood-onset disease manifests during the first months or years of life. In the newborn period, presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, including seizures, hypotonia, poor feeding, and apnea. In severe cases, serum glucose concentrations are typically extremely low and thus easily recognized, whereas in milder cases, variable and mild hypoglycemia may make the diagnosis more difficult. Even within the same family, disease manifestations can range from mild to severe. Individuals with autosomal recessive familial hyperinsulinism (FHI-KATP), caused by mutations in either ABCC8 or KCNJ11, tend to be large for gestational age and usually present with severe refractory hypoglycemia in the first 48 hours of life; affected infants usually respond only partially to diet or medical management (i.e., diazoxide therapy) and thus may require pancreatic resection. Individuals with autosomal dominant FHI tend to be appropriate for gestational age at birth, to present at approximately age one year (range: 2 days - 30 years), and to respond to diet and diazoxide therapy. FHI-GCK, caused by mutations in GCK, was initially thought to be much milder than FHI-KATP; however, some persons have severe, diazoxide-unresponsive hypoglycemia. Hyperammonemia/hyperinsulinism (HA/HI) is associated with mild-to-moderate hyperammonemia and with relatively mild, late-onset hypoglycemia; most but not all affected individuals have mutations in GLUD1.

Approximately 40% of individuals with FHI do not have an identifiable mutation in any of the genes known to be associated with FHI. In the Ashkenazi Jewish population, two ABCC8 founder mutations are responsible for approximately 90% of FHI. Another ABCC8 founder mutation, p.Val187Asp, is present in the Finnish population.

In individuals in whom aggressive medical management fails to maintain plasma glucose concentration within safe limits, or in whom such therapy cannot be safely maintained over time, pancreatic resection is considered.

Surveillance: Monitoring of plasma glucose concentrations, especially during intercurrent illness. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged fasting of any sort.

Neuromuscular manifestations include a (mostly subclinical) sensorimotor axonopathy and muscle weakness or atrophy of different degrees. Hematologically, MLS is defined as a specific blood group phenotype (named after the first proband, Hugh McLeod) that results from absent expression of the Kx erythrocyte antigen and weakened expression of Kell blood group antigens. The hematologic manifestations are red blood cell acanthocytosis and compensated hemolysis. Allo-antibodies in the Kell and Kx blood group system can cause strong reactions to transfusions of incompatible blood and severe anemia in newborns of Kell-negative mothers.

Onset ranges from before birth to adolescence or young adulthood. Poor weight gain, sleep difficulties, pneumonia, scoliosis, and joint contractures are common complications. Before the genetic basis of SMA was understood, it was classified into clinical subtypes; however, it is now apparent that the phenotype of SMA associated with disease-causing mutations of the SMN1 gene spans a continuum without clear delineation of subtypes. Nonetheless, classification by age of onset and maximum function achieved is useful for prognosis and management; subtypes include: SMA 0 (proposed), with prenatal onset and severe joint contractures, facial diplegia, and respiratory failure; SMA I, with onset before age six months; SMA II, with onset between age six and 12 months; SMA III, with onset in childhood after age 12 months; and SMA IV, with adult onset."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"The diagnosis of SMA is based on molecular genetic testing. The two genes associated with SMA are SMN1 and SMN2. SMN1 (survival motor neuron 1) is the primary disease-causing gene. About 95%-98% of individuals with SMA are homozygous for a deletion or truncation of SMN1 and about 2%-5% are compound heterozygotes for an SMN1 deletion or truncation and an SMN1 intragenic mutation. SMN1 deletion or truncation is typically detected by demonstrating the absence of exon 7 because it can be differentiated from exon 7 of SMN2. SMA carrier testing, a PCR-based dosage assay, allows determination of the number of SMN1 copies by measuring the number of exon 7-containing SMN1 copies. This test can be difficult to interpret because instead of having the normal two copies of SMN1, one on each chromosome, some carriers have the two SMN1 copies on one chromosome and some carriers have an SMN1 intragenic mutation that is not detected by this test. Furthermore, 2% of individuals with SMA have one de novo mutation, meaning that only one parent is a carrier. Because of these difficulties in SMA carrier test interpretation, SMA carrier testing should be provided in the context of formal genetic counseling."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Treatment of manifestations: When nutrition is a concern in SMA, placement of a gastrostomy tube is appropriate.

These recurrence risks deviate slightly from the norm for autosomal recessive inheritance because, in about 2% of cases, the affected individual has a de novo SMN1 mutation on one allele; in these instances only one parent is a carrier of an SMN1 mutation, and thus the sibs are not at increased risk for SMA.

Cardinal manifestations involve the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. FBN1 mutations associate with a broad phenotypic continuum, ranging from isolated features of Marfan syndrome to neonatal presentation of severe and rapidly progressive disease in multiple organ systems. Myopia is the most common ocular feature; displacement of the lens from the center of the pupil, seen in approximately 60% of affected individuals, is a hallmark feature. People with Marfan syndrome are at increased risk for retinal detachment, glaucoma, and early cataract formation. The skeletal system involvement is characterized by bone overgrowth and joint laxity. The extremities are disproportionately long for the size of the trunk (dolichostenomelia). Overgrowth of the ribs can push the sternum in (pectus excavatum) or out (pectus carinatum). Scoliosis is common and can be mild or severe and progressive. The major sources of morbidity and early mortality in the Marfan syndrome relate to the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular manifestations include dilatation of the aorta at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva, a predisposition for aortic tear and rupture, mitral valve prolapse with or without regurgitation, tricuspid valve prolapse, and enlargement of the proximal pulmonary artery. With proper management, the life expectancy of someone with Marfan syndrome approximates that of the general population."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"Marfan syndrome is a clinical diagnosis based on family history and the observation of characteristic findings in multiple organ systems. Ectopia lentis and aortic aneurysm are given special significance in the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome because of their relative specificity or frequency and clinical significance, respectively.

It remains unclear whether the lack of full sensitivity of this test relates to an atypical location or character of FBN1 mutations in some individuals (e.g., large deletions or promoter mutations) or to locus heterogeneity."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Treatment of manifestations: Comprehensive management by a multidisciplinary team including a geneticist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, orthopedist, and cardiothoracic surgeon. Eyeglasses for most eye problems; rare need for surgical removal of a dislocated lens with implantation of an artificial lens (preferably after growth is complete). Surgical stabilization of the spine for scoliosis and repair of pectus deformity (largely for cosmetic indications. Orthotics and arch supports can lessen leg fatigue and muscle cramps associated with pes planus. Surgical repair of the aorta when the maximal measurement approaches 5.0 cm in adults or older children, the rate of increase of the aortic diameter approaches 1.0 cm per year, or progressive aortic regurgitation occurs. Afterload-reducing agents can improve cardiovascular function when congestive heart failure is present. Prevention of primary manifestations: Medications that reduce hemodynamic stress on the aortic wall, such as beta blockers, are generally initiated at diagnosis or for progressive aortic dilatation. Other antihypertensive agents can be used if beta blockers are not tolerated; however, little evidence exists as to their efficacy and safety in Marfan syndrome. Prevention of secondary complications: Subacute bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis for dental work with the presence of mitral or aortic valve regurgitation. Surveillance: Annual ophthalmologic examination; annual echocardiography to monitor the status of the ascending aorta when aortic dimensions are small and/or the rate of aortic dilation is slow; more frequent examinations are indicated when the aortic root diameter exceeds approximately 4.5 centimeters in adults, rates of aortic dilation exceed approximately 0.5 cm per year, and significant aortic regurgitation is present; intermittent surveillance of the entire aorta with CT or MRA scans beginning in young adulthood. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports, competitive sports, and isometric exercise; activities that cause joint injury or pain; agents that stimulate the cardiovascular system, including decongestants and caffeine; LASIK correction of refractive errors; breathing against resistance or positive pressure ventilation in those with a documented predisposition for pneumothorax. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Echocardiography in relatives suspected of having Marfan syndrome and in apparently unaffected relatives if findings are subtle in the index case. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women with Marfan syndrome should be followed by a high-risk obstetrician both during pregnancy and through the immediate postpartum period. In women with Marfan syndrome who anticipate pregnancy or become pregnant, beta blockers should be continued, but some other classes of medications such as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be stopped because of the risk of fetal loss and birth defects. Cardiovascular imaging with echocardiography every two to three months during pregnancy to monitor aortic root size and growth.

Adult males with KS tend to have pre-pubertal testicular volume (i.e., <4 mL), absence of secondary sexual features (e.g., facial and axillary hair growth, deepening of the voice), decreased muscle mass, decreased bone densities, diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility. Adult females have little or no breast development and primary amenorrhea. Body habitus is usually eunuchoidal with arm span exceeding height by 5 cm or more. Although skeletal maturation is delayed, the rate of linear growth is usually normal (except for the absence of a distinct pubertal growth spurt).

Together, mutations in these six genes account for about 25%-35% of all KS. Deletion of KAL1 by FISH or array GH (genomic hybridization) is an extremely rare cause of KS. Sequence analysis of KAL1 can identify KAL1 point mutations in 5%-10% of familial and simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family). Approximately 10% of individuals with KS have mutations in FGFR1, approximately 5% in PROKR2 or CHD7, and fewer than 5% in FGF8 or PROK2.

Individuals with the severe forms of low γ-GT familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC1 and PFIC2) typically begin to exhibit symptoms of cholestasis (pruritus and attacks of jaundice) within the first few months of life; secondary manifestations such as malabsorption, greasy stools, and poor weight gain may present earlier than three months of age. Initially episodes of severe cholestasis are followed by disease-free intervals; eventually, cholestasis becomes non-remitting. Pruritus is typically severe and persistent. Growth retardation becomes evident in early childhood. Cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and death usually ensue within the first two decades of life in the absence of surgical intervention. Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC1 and BRIC2) are the milder forms of low γ-GT familial intrahepatic cholestasis, and are characterized by episodes of cholestasis, severe pruritus, and jaundice; chronic liver damage does not develop. Some heterozygous women experience intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), in which symptoms typically appear during the third trimester and resolve postpartum."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"The diagnosis of PFIC1 and PFIC2 is primarily based on clinical and laboratory findings. Low-to-normal serum γ-GT activity despite conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is the hallmark of PFIC1 and PFIC2, as γ-GT activity is elevated in most types of cholestasis. Serum cholesterol concentration is low to normal. Serum concentration of total bile acids is elevated. Fast-atom bombardment ionization mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) analysis of urine shows normal bile acid species and indicates normal bile acid synthesis. Liver biopsy at initial presentation shows either bland intracanalicular cholestasis or \"neonatal hepatitis\" with portal-tract fibrosis and bile ductular proliferation; underlying hepatobiliary structural abnormalities are not present, but may develop over time. Either coarsely granular canalicular bile or amorphous canalicular bile may be found on transmission electron microscopy (TEM). PFIC1 is caused by mutations in the ATP8B1 gene (also termed FIC1); PFIC2 is caused by mutations in the ABCB11 gene (also termed BSEP). Although clinical, histopathologic, and ultrastructural differences between PFIC1 and PFIC2 have been observed, it is not possible to distinguish between the two without molecular genetic testing. Molecular genetic testing for mutations in the ATP8B1 and ABCB11 genes is available on a clinical basis."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Low γ-GT familial intrahepatic cholestasis is generally refractory to medical treatment. Standard therapies for pruritus associated with cholestasis may be temporarily effective but in the long term are relatively ineffective. Nutritional therapy includes infant formulas with significant proportions of medium chain triglycerides, which can be absorbed relatively independent of bile flow. Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation using special preparations of vitamin E is useful in severe cholestasis. Partial biliary diversion (PBD) surgery in individuals with severe disease interrupts the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and reduces pruritus; in some individuals it even slows or reverses progression to hepatic fibrosis. Types of PBD include cutaneous cholecystostomy, cholecysto-jejuno-cutaneostomy, and cholecysto-appendico-cutaneostomy. An alternative surgical procedure is ileal exclusion.   When liver disease progresses to cirrhosis or fails to respond to PBD, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) is necessary for long-term survival; Bile acid chelators and clonidine may ameliorate diarrhea after OLTX.

With detailed radiographic and bone morphologic studies and molecular genetic analyses, the classification has expanded to seven types and it is likely that more will emerge.

Wilms tumor usually presents as an abdominal mass in an otherwise apparently healthy child. Wilms tumor has the potential for both local and distant spread. Approximately 5%-10% of children with Wilms tumor have bilateral or multicentric tumors. The average age at presentation is 42-47 months for children with unilateral Wilms tumor and 30-33 months for those with bilateral Wilms tumor. Current models of Wilms tumor development propose that a genetic mutation predisposes to nephrogenic rests (benign foci of embryonal kidney cells that persist abnormally into postnatal life). Nephrogenic rests are characterized as intralobar or perilobar. In general, intralobar rests (usually single lesions within the renal lobe, renal sinus, or calyceal walls) are associated with the WAGR (Wilms tumor-aniridia-genital anomalies-retardation) syndrome and Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS). In general, perilobar rests (usually multiple lesions in the periphery of the renal lobe) are associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and hemi-hypertrophy. However, the association between type of nephrogenic rest and predisposition syndrome is not absolute."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"The workup of a child with suspected Wilms tumor begins with appropriate diagnostic imaging studies.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may facilitate the distinction between Wilms tumor and nephrogenic rests. The definitive diagnosis of Wilms tumor can be made only by surgical resection or biopsy."},{"Label":"CAUSES","value":"A germline mutation is thought to be the cause of about 10%-15% of Wilms tumor. WT1 germline mutations give rise to WAGR syndrome, DDS, Frasier syndrome, and isolated Wilms tumor (i.e., Wilms tumor with no evidence of an underlying syndrome). Epigenetic and genomic alterations of chromosome 11p15 give rise to BWS. Approximately 1%-2% of individuals with Wilms tumor have at least one relative also diagnosed with Wilms tumor; however, the underlying genetic mechanisms are usually not known. Linkage analysis has mapped Wilms tumor predisposition genes to 17q (locus name FWT1) and 19q (locus name FWT2). Because in some families the Wilms tumor phenotype does not show linkage to WT1, FWT1, or FWT2, the existence of one or more other genes in which mutations cause familial Wilms tumor is likely."},{"Label":"GENETIC COUNSELING","value":"If a proband has syndromic Wilms tumor, genetic counseling for the specific syndrome is appropriate.

Surgery, a cornerstone of treatment, is performed at the time of diagnosis or after 4-8 weeks of preoperative chemotherapy. Because Wilms tumor can spread to the lungs, preoperative chest radiography or chest CT scans are imperative. Nephron-sparing surgery is routinely advocated for those with bilateral Wilms tumor. Chemotherapy includes vincristine and dactinomycin for stage I and II favorable histology Wilms tumor and vincristine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin for stage III or IV favorable histology disease. Treatment for anaplastic Wilms tumor includes vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin. After surgery children with advanced disease (stage III or IV) undergo radiation therapy. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is treated initially with dialysis, followed by renal transplantation when possible. Surveillance: (1) For children with BWS or isolated hemihypertrophy: abdominal ultrasound examination every three months until age eight years.

The underlying cause of these episodes is the onset of fast ventricular tachycardia (bidirectional or polymorphic). Spontaneous recovery occurs when these arrhythmias self-terminate. In other instances, ventricular tachycardia may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and cause sudden death if cardiopulmonary resuscitation is not readily available. The mean age of onset of CPVT is between seven and nine years; onset as late as the fourth decade of life has been reported. If untreated CPVT is highly lethal, as approximately 30% of affected individuals experience at least one cardiac arrest and up 80% one or more syncopal spells."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"The diagnosis is based on the detection of the typical ventricular tachycardia reproducibly elicited during acute adrenergic activation (e.g., exercise, acute emotion). The bidirectional tachycardia is defined as a ventricular arrhythmia with an alternating 180°-QRS axis on a beat-to-beat basis; some individuals also have polymorphic VT without a \"stable\" QRS vector alternans.

Although there are no comparative studies, the majority of international referral centers use nadolol (1-2.5 mg/kg/day) or propranolol (2-4 mg/kg /day). Reproducible induction of arrhythmia during exercise allows titration and monitoring of the dose of beta-blockers, the only intervention of proven efficacy in preventing recurrence of syncope in the majority of affected individuals; an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) may be necessary for those with recurrent cardiac arrest while on beta-blocker therapy or for those unable to take beta-blockers. Recent data suggest that flecainide can be added to beta-blockers to improve arrhythmia control. Prevention of primary manifestations: Beta-blockers are indicated for all clinically affected individuals and probably for individuals with an RYR2 mutation with no history of cardiac events (syncope) or ventricular arrhythmias on exercise stress testing. Prevention of secondary complications: To avoid exacerbation of allergic asthma, use of the cardiac-specific beta-blocker, metoprolol, may be added using doses based on patient need. Anticoagulation may be necessary for some persons with an ICD. Surveillance: Follow-up visits with a cardiologist every six to 12 months (depending on disease severity) to monitor the efficacy of therapy. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Competitive sports and other strenuous exercise. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Because treatment and surveillance are available to reduce morbidity and mortality in individuals known to have a disease-causing mutation, first-degree relatives of a proband should be offered molecular genetic testing if the family-specific mutation is known; if the family-specific mutation is not known, all first-degree relatives of an affected individual should be evaluated with resting ECG, Holter monitoring, and exercise stress testing."},{"Label":"GENETIC COUNSELING","value":"Autosomal dominant CPVT: RYR2-related CPVT is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

IGD can first be apparent in infancy, adolescence, or adulthood. Infant boys with congenital (i.e., present at birth) IGD often have micropenis and cryptorchidism. Adolescents and adults with IGD have clinical evidence of hypogonadism and incomplete sexual maturation on physical examination. Adult males with IGD tend to have prepubertal testicular volume (i.e., <4 mL), absence of secondary sexual features (e.g., facial and axillary hair growth, deepening of the voice), decreased muscle mass, diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility.

The identification of three major clinical types (1, 2, and 3) and two other subtypes (perinatal-lethal and cardiovascular) is useful in determining prognosis and management. GD type 1 is characterized by the presence of clinical or radiographic evidence of bone disease (osteopenia, focal lytic or sclerotic lesions, and osteonecrosis), hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and thrombocytopenia, lung disease, and the absence of primary central nervous system disease. GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by the presence of primary neurologic disease; in the past, they were distinguished by age of onset and rate of disease progression, but these distinctions are not absolute. Disease with onset before age two years, limited psychomotor development, and a rapidly progressive course with death by age two to four years is classified as GD type 2. Individuals with GD type 3 may have onset before age two years, but often have a more slowly progressive course and may live into the third or fourth decade. The perinatal-lethal form is associated with ichthyosiform or collodion skin abnormalities or with nonimmune hydrops fetalis. The cardiovascular form is characterized by calcification of the aortic and mitral valves, mild splenomegaly, corneal opacities, and supranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Cardiopulmonary complications have been described with all the clinical subtypes, although varying in frequency and severity."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"The diagnosis of GD relies on demonstration of deficient glucosylceramidase enzyme activity in peripheral blood leukocytes or other nucleated cells. Carrier testing by assay of enzyme activity is unreliable because of overlap in enzyme activity between carriers and non-carriers. Identification of two disease-causing alleles in GBA, the only gene in which mutations are known to cause GD, provides additional confirmation of the diagnosis but should not be used for diagnosis in lieu of biochemical testing."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Treatment of manifestations: When possible, management by a multidisciplinary team at a Comprehensive Gaucher Center. For persons not receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT), symptomatic treatment includes partial or total splenectomy for massive splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. Supportive care for all affected individuals may include: transfusion of blood products for severe anemia and bleeding, analgesics for bone pain, joint replacement surgery for relief from chronic pain and restoration of function, and oral bisphosphonates and calcium for osteopenia. Prevention of primary manifestations: ERT is usually well tolerated and provides sufficient exogenous enzyme to overcome the block in the catabolic pathway, clearing the stored substrate, GL1, and thus reversing hematologic and liver/spleen involvement. Individuals with severe GD, primarily those with chronic neurologic involvement (GD type 3), can benefit from bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Miglustat may be indicated in symptomatic individuals with GD type 1 who are not able to receive ERT. Surveillance: Recommendations for comprehensive serial monitoring have been published by the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Registry (ICGG) and other groups.

At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Targeted mutation analysis can be used to detect carriers in high-risk populations (e.g., Ashkenazi Jewish persons). Because the carrier frequency for GD in certain populations is high (e.g., 1:18 in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage) and the N370S/N370S phenotype is variable, individuals who undergo carrier testing may be identified as being homozygous.

They can be caused by mutations of nuclear or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Some mitochondrial disorders only affect a single organ (e.g., the eye in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy [LHON]), but many involve multiple organ systems and often present with prominent neurologic and myopathic features. Mitochondrial disorders may present at any age. Many affected individuals display a cluster of clinical features that fall into a discrete clinical syndrome, such as the Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), neurogenic weakness with ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), or Leigh syndrome (LS). However, considerable clinical variability exists and many individuals do not fit neatly into one particular category. Common clinical features of mitochondrial disease include ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, proximal myopathy and exercise intolerance, cardiomyopathy, sensorineural deafness, optic atrophy, pigmentary retinopathy, and diabetes mellitus. Common central nervous system findings are fluctuating encephalopathy, seizures, dementia, migraine, stroke-like episodes, ataxia, and spasticity. A high incidence of mid- and late pregnancy loss is a common occurrence that often goes unrecognized."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"In some individuals, the clinical picture is characteristic of a specific mitochondrial disorder (e.g., LHON, NARP, or maternally inherited LS), and the diagnosis can be confirmed by molecular genetic testing of DNA extracted from a blood sample.

Nuclear gene defects may be inherited in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner. Mitochondrial DNA defects are transmitted by maternal inheritance. Mitochondrial DNA deletions generally occur de novo and thus cause disease in one family member only, with no significant risk to other family members. Mitochondrial DNA point mutations and duplications may be transmitted down the maternal line. The father of a proband is not at risk of having the disease-causing mtDNA mutation, but the mother of a proband (usually) has the mitochondrial mutation and may or may not have symptoms. A male does not transmit the mtDNA mutation to his offspring. A female harboring a heteroplasmic mtDNA point mutation may transmit a variable amount of mutant mtDNA to her offspring, resulting in considerable clinical variability among sibs within the same family. Prenatal genetic testing and interpretation of test results for mtDNA disorders are difficult because of mtDNA heteroplasmy."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Treatment of manifestations: The management of mitochondrial disease is largely supportive and may include early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus, cardiac pacing, ptosis correction, and intraocular lens replacement for cataracts.

The genetic cause of some forms of Parkinson disease has been identified. Seven disease genes have been implicated. Mutations in three known genes, SNCA (PARK1), UCHL1 (PARK5), and LRRK2 (PARK8) and one mapped gene (PARK3) result in autosomal dominant Parkinson disease. Mutations in three known genes, PARK2 (PARK2), PARK7 (PARK7), and PINK1 (PARK6), result in autosomal recessive Parkinson disease. Three susceptibility genes have been identified.

The risk to first-degree relatives of a person with Parkinson disease varies from study to study and from country to country. In families with a non-mendelian form of Parkinson disease, first-degree relatives of an affected individual are between 2.7 and 3.5 times more likely to develop Parkinson disease than individuals without a family history of Parkinson disease.

Abdominal pain, the most common symptom, is often the initial sign of an acute attack which can include nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, abdominal distention, ileus, urinary retention, incontinence, and dysuria. Peripheral neuropathy can cause weakness in the arms or legs; motor neuropathy may involve the cranial nerves. Permanent quadriplegia may occur after a severe attack. Psychiatric findings include insomnia, agitation, hysteria, anxiety, apathy or depression, phobias, psychosis, organic disorders, delirium, somnolence, or coma. Recovery from acute attacks can occur within days, but recovery from severe attacks that are not promptly treated may take weeks or months. Death may occur in an acute attack from paralysis of respiratory muscles or cardiovascular failure from electrolyte imbalance. Risks for hepatocellular carcinoma and renal insufficiency are increased. Factors that can precipitate an attack of AIP include fasting, stress, infection, strenuous exercise, fluctuations in female hormones, administration of a porphyrogenic prescription drug or sex hormone, or exposure to organic solvent, biocide, cannabis, smoking, components in wine, and spirits including alcohols and congeners."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"During an acute AIP attack the color of the urine is red or red-brown and urinary concentration of porphobilinogen (PBG) is increased.

Acute attacks: prompt administration of hemin (hematin, heme albumin, or heme arginate) is the specific treatment of choice to curtail acute neurovisceral attacks and avoid paresis. Mild attacks: 10%-20% dextrose in normal saline is given IV initially, followed by administration of IV hemin, if needed. Prevention of primary manifestations: Acute attacks are prevented by: counseling the patient in habits/life style that avoid triggering agents; prompt treatment of infections; consideration of long-acting agonistic GnRH analogs to inhibit ovulation and prevent premenstrual attacks in women with cyclic exacerbations of AIP. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Stress, irregular meals, dieting, alcohol, smoking, and cannabis; prescription drugs and herbal medicines known to be porphyrogenic; and biocides or solvents (e.g., in painting or cleaning).

In about 25% of cases, visual loss is bilateral at onset. Visual acuity is severely reduced to counting fingers or worse in the majority of cases, and visual field testing shows an enlarging dense central or centrocecal scotoma.

Manifestations of malignant hyperthermia (MH) are precipitated by certain volatile anesthetics (i.e., halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, enflurane), either alone or in conjunction with depolarizing muscle relaxants (succinylcholine). The triggering substances release calcium stores from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing contracture of skeletal muscles, glycogenolysis, and increased cellular metabolism, resulting in production of heat and excess lactate. Affected individuals experience: acidosis, hypercapnia, tachycardia, hypoxemia, rhabdomyolysis with subsequent increase in serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration, hyperkalemia with a risk of cardiac arrhythmia or even arrest, and myoglobinuria with a risk of renal failure. In nearly all cases, the first manifestations of MH, tachycardia and tachypnea, occur in the operating room; however, MH may also occur in the early postoperative period. There is mounting evidence that some patients will also develop MH with exercise and/or on exposure to hot environments. Death results without prompt treatment."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"A clinical grading scale helps determine if a malignant hyperthermia (MH) episode has occurred.

To date, two genes predisposing to MHS have been identified; three additional loci have been mapped, but the genes have not been identified. MHS1 is associated with mutations in the gene RYR1, encoding ryanodine receptor type 1; MHS5 is associated with mutations in the gene CACNA1S, encoding skeletal muscle calcium channel.

Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid extremes of heat, but do not restrict athletic activity unless overt rhabdomyolysis occurs.

Most organic acidemias result from dysfunction of a specific step in amino acid catabolism, usually the result of deficient enzyme activity. The majority of the classic organic acid disorders are caused by abnormal amino acid catabolism of branched-chain amino acids or lysine. They include maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, isovaleric acidemia, biotin-unresponsive 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) lyase deficiency, ketothiolase deficiency, and glutaricacidemia type I (GA I). A neonate affected with an OA is usually well at birth and for the first few days of life. The usual clinical presentation is that of toxic encephalopathy and includes vomiting, poor feeding, neurologic symptoms such as seizures and abnormal tone, and lethargy progressing to coma. Outcome is enhanced by diagnosis and treatment in the first ten days of life. In the older child or adolescent, variant forms of the OAs can present as loss of intellectual function, ataxia or other focal neurologic signs, Reye syndrome, recurrent ketoacidosis, or psychiatric symptoms."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"Clinical laboratory findings that suggest an organic acidemia include acidosis, ketosis, hyperammonemia, abnormal liver function tests, hypoglycemia, and neutropenia. First-line diagnosis in the organic acidemias is urine organic acid analysis using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS), utilizing a capillary column. The urinary organic acid profile is nearly always abnormal in the face of acute illness with decompensation; however, in some disorders diagnostic analytes may be present only in small or barely detectable amounts when the affected individual is not acutely ill. Depending on the specific disorder, plasma amino acid analysis using a quantitative method such as column chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or GC/MS can also be helpful. A plasma or serum acylcarnitine profile can also provide a rapid clue to the diagnosis. Urine acylcarnitine profiling is more complex and interpretation can be difficult. Confirmatory testing involves assay of the activity of the deficient enzyme in lymphocytes or cultured fibroblasts and/or molecular genetic testing."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Treatment of manifestations: The aim of therapy is to restore biochemical and physiologic homeostasis. Neonates require emergency diagnosis and treatment depending on the specific biochemical lesion, the position of the metabolic block, and the effects of the toxic compounds. Treatment strategies include: (1) dietary restriction of the precursor amino acids and (2) use of adjunctive compounds to (a) dispose of toxic metabolites or (b) increase activity of deficient enzymes. Frequent monitoring of growth, development, and biochemical parameters is essential. Decompensation caused by catabolic stress (e.g., from vomiting, diarrhea, febrile illness, and decreased oral intake) requires prompt and aggressive intervention. Liver transplantation has been successful in a small number of affected individuals. Post-partum monitoring of women with an OA is important in this time of metabolic stress."},{"Label":"GENETIC COUNSELING","value":"The organic acidemias considered in this overview are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of a proband has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members is possible if the disease-causing mutations in the family are known. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk varies by disorder and may include measurement of analytes in amniotic fluid, measurement of enzyme activity, or molecular genetic testing in cells obtained by CVS or amniocentesis."}]},"Language":"eng","ContributionDate":{"Day":"27","Month":"06","Year":"2001"},"Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"oa-overview","book":"gene","sec":"oa-overview.Summary","value":"Summary"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"oa-overview","book":"gene","sec":"oa-overview.Definition","value":"Definition"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"oa-overview","book":"gene","sec":"oa-overview.Causes","value":"Causes"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"oa-overview","book":"gene","sec":"oa-overview.Evaluation_Strategy","value":"Evaluation Strategy"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"oa-overview","book":"gene","sec":"oa-overview.Genetic_Counseling","value":"Genetic Counseling"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"oa-overview","book":"gene","sec":"oa-overview.Management","value":"Management"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"oa-overview","book":"gene","sec":"oa-overview.Resources","value":"Resources"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"oa-overview","book":"gene","sec":"oa-overview.References","value":"References"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"oa-overview","book":"gene","sec":"oa-overview.Chapter_Notes","value":"Chapter Notes"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"20301313","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2010","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2010","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2010","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

In one study of autosomal dominant OPMD, the mean age of onset for ptosis was 48 years (range 26-65 years) and for dysphagia was 50 years (range 40-63 years). All individuals were symptomatic by age 70 years. Early symptoms of dysphagia are an increased time needed to complete a meal and an acquired avoidance of dry foods. Other signs observed as the disease progresses are tongue atrophy and weakness (82%), proximal lower extremity weakness (71%), dysphonia (67%), limitation of upward gaze (61%), facial muscle weakness (43%), and proximal upper extremity weakness (38%). Severe cases represent 5% to 10% of all cases. These individuals have earlier onset of ptosis and dysphagia (<45 years) and an incapacitating proximal leg weakness that starts before age 60 years. Some individuals eventually need a wheelchair. Life expectancy is not reduced."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"Diagnosis of OPMD is based on clinical criteria. PABPN1, encoding the polyadenylate binding protein nuclear 1, is the only gene known to be associated with OPMD. Confirmatory molecular diagnosis of both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive OPMD depends on detection of an expansion of a GCN trinucleotide repeat in the first exon of PABPN1. Such testing is available clinically. Normal alleles contain ten GCG trinucleotide repeats [i.e., (GCN)10]. Autosomal dominant alleles range in size from 12 to 17 GCN repeats [i.e., (GCN)12-17]. Autosomal recessive alleles contain 11 GCN repeats [i.e., (GCN)11]. Muscle biopsy is warranted only in individuals with suspected OPMD who have two normal PABPN1 alleles."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Treatment for ptosis may include blepharoplasty - either resection of the levator palpebrea aponeurosis or frontal suspension of the eyelids. Treatment for dysphagia may include surgical intervention in the presence of very symptomatic dysphagia, marked weight loss, near-fatal choking (which is extremely rare), or recurrent pneumonia. Cricopharyngeal myotomy alleviates symptoms in most cases. Dysphagia reappears slowly over years in many individuals. Contraindications to surgery are severe dysphonia and lower esophageal sphincter incompetence. The frequency of the follow-up neurologic evaluations depends on the degree of ptosis, dysphagia, and muscle weakness. Ophthalmologic evaluation should be performed when ptosis interferes with driving or is associated with neck pain or when the eyelids cover more than 50% of the pupils. Swallowing evaluation and surgical consultations are requested when dysphagia becomes cumbersome."},{"Label":"GENETIC COUNSELING","value":"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy is inherited in either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive manner. For autosomal dominant OPMD, the risk to each sib of inheriting the mutation is 50% if a proband has an expanded (GCN)12-17. Each child of an individual heterozygous for one expanded allele (GCN)12-17 has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease-causing mutation. A proband with autosomal dominant OPMD may have the disorder as the result of a de novo mutation. The proportion of cases caused by de novo mutations is unknown, but appears to be small. A single case of an individual with autosomal recessive OPMD who was homozygous for the (GCG)11 allele has been reported. The offspring of an individual with autosomal recessive OPMD are obligate heterozygotes (carriers) for a mutant allele causing OPMD. The risk of the child being affected is less than 1%. Prenatal testing is technically possible for pregnancies at risk if molecular genetic testing of the affected parent has revealed the GCG triplet repeat in PABPN1; however, requests for prenatal testing for adult-onset conditions such as OPMD that do not affect intellect or life span, result in relatively mild physical limitations, and require that the asymptomatic at-risk parent be tested to confirm the at-risk status of the fetus are very uncommon."}]},"Language":"eng","ContributionDate":{"Day":"08","Month":"03","Year":"2001"},"Sections":{"Section":[{"SectionTitle":{"part":"opmd","book":"gene","sec":"opmd.Summary","value":"Summary"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"opmd","book":"gene","sec":"opmd.Diagnosis","value":"Diagnosis"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"opmd","book":"gene","sec":"opmd.Clinical_Description","value":"Clinical Description"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"opmd","book":"gene","sec":"opmd.Differential_Diagnosis","value":"Differential Diagnosis"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"opmd","book":"gene","sec":"opmd.Management","value":"Management"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"opmd","book":"gene","sec":"opmd.Genetic_Counseling","value":"Genetic Counseling"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"opmd","book":"gene","sec":"opmd.Molecular_Genetics","value":"Molecular Genetics"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"opmd","book":"gene","sec":"opmd.Resources","value":"Resources"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"opmd","book":"gene","sec":"opmd.References","value":"References"}},{"SectionTitle":{"part":"opmd","book":"gene","sec":"opmd.Chapter_Notes","value":"Chapter Notes"}}]}},"PubmedBookData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"20301305","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2010","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2010","Hour":"6"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2010","Hour":"6"}]}}}},

Early dental treatment may range from simple restorations to dentures. In children over age seven years, dental implants in the anterior portion of the mandibular arch may be beneficial to aid prosthesis retention if the child has no teeth and cannot wear a conventional removable prosthesis. Replacement of dental prostheses should be provided as needed, often every 2.5 years. Nasal and aural concretions may be removed with suction devices or forceps as needed by an otolaryngologist.

Although autoimmunity is often not present at the time of diagnosis or at the time of the most extensive lymphoproliferation, autoantibodies can be detected before autoimmune disease manifests clinically. ALPS-FAS, caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in FAS, and characterized by severe lymphoproliferation before, at, or shortly after birth, usually results in death at an early age. ALPS-sFAS, resulting from somatic FAS mutations in selected cell populations, notably the alpha/beta double-negative T cells (α/β-DNT cells), appears to be similar to ALPS-FAS resulting from germline mutations in FAS, keeping in mind that patients with somatic mutations need to be better characterized."},{"Label":"DIAGNOSIS/TESTING","value":"The diagnosis of ALPS is based on clinical findings; laboratory abnormalities, including defective in vitro tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (Fas)-mediated apoptosis and T cells that express the alpha/beta T-cell receptor but lack both CD4 and CD8 (so-called α/β-DNT cells); and identification of mutations in genes relevant for the Fas pathway of apoptosis. Mutations in FAS (TNFRSF6) are associated with ALPS-FAS and ALPS-sFAS. Mutations in FASLG (previously known as FASL, TNFSF6) and CASP10 have been identified in a few individuals with ALPS. Molecular genetic testing of FAS, FASLG, and CASP10 is available clinically."},{"Label":"MANAGEMENT","value":"Treatment of manifestations: Lymphoproliferation can be suppressed with corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Because lymphadenopathy and organomegaly invariably return once these agents are discontinued, one approach is to use immunosuppressive therapy only for severe complications of lymphoproliferation (e.g., airway obstruction) and/or autoimmune manifestations. Early experience with sirolimus suggests that it can reverse both proliferative and autoimmune features in ALPS; however, sirolimus is not without side-effects. Lymphoma is treated with conventional protocols. Bone marrow (hematopoietic stem cell) transplantation (BMT/HSCT), the only curative treatment for ALPS, has to date mostly been performed on patients with severe clinical phenotypes such as ALPS-FAS caused by biallelic mutations, or those with lymphoma, and those who developed complications from (often long-term) immunosuppressive therapy. Surveillance: Clinical assessment, imaging and laboratory studies for manifestations of lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity, and specialized imaging studies to detect malignant transformation. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Splenectomy typically does not lead to permanent remission of autoimmunity and may be associated with increased risk of infections. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used with caution in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) as they can interfere with platelet function.

It is demonstrated in the present investigation that in the highly reactive inbred BALB/cByJ mouse, the relatively hardy C57BL/6ByJ strain, as well as in the noninbred CD-1 strain, acute psychogenic (predator exposure) and neurogenic (footshock) stressors reduced splenic macrophage activity, and this effect was less marked after a chronic stressor. With protracted, but not transient, psychosocial disturbances (isolated housing) similar effects were seen, suggesting that the effect was not simply due to a change of the social mileau. The psychogenic and neurogenic stressors also enhanced LPS-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation in CD-1, but not in the inbred strains. However, isolated housing reduced both B and T cell proliferation, indicating that social isolation likely affects processes distinct from those of other stressors. Interestingly, when the aversiveness of the psychogenic stressor was increased (by decreasing the distance between the rat and the mouse) LPS-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was reduced in the reactive BALB/cByJ strain, but increased in the hardy C57BL/6ByJ mice.

Therefore, the anthropogenic fluxes, the changing quality of areas as well as the processes between the environmental fields are taken into account. The approach is based on methodical elements of te Life Cycle Analysis and the Environmental Impact Assessment. Looking at the 'urban systems' within the communal activities, 'ecological modelling' gives us a new and fuller picture of the spatial and temporal character of urban metabolism. The approach supports the perception of cumulative effects and the postponement of environmental problems and opens new horizons for process-oriented environmental planning within the community. Greater efficiency and a decrease in costs can be arrived at by leaving 'end of the pipe' strategies; opportunities for a better planning process and measures for different individuals and organisations can be drawn up. A data base which acts as a 'support system' implements the computer-aided approach to environmental accounting."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"21","Month":"05","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"19009395"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0944-1344","MedlineTA":"Environ Sci Pollut Res Int","NlmUniqueID":"9441769","Country":"Germany"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1007/BF02987622","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"19009395","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"13","PubStatus":"received","Month":"7","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"17","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"12","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

This organic matter is analyzed as solvent extractable bitumen/ lipids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The organic geochemical approach assesses the origin, the environmental history and the nature of secondary products of organic matter by using the data derived from specific molecular analyses. Evaluations of production and fluxes, with cross-correlations can thus be made by the application of the same separation and analytical procedures to samples from point source emissions and the ambient atmosphere. This will be illustrated here with typical examples from the ambient atmosphere (aerosol particles) and from emissions of biomass burning (smoke). Organic matter in aerosols is derived from two major sources and is admixed depending on the geographic relief of the air shed. These sources are biogenic detritus (e.g., plant wax, microbes, etc.) and anthropogenic particle emissions (e.g., oils, soot, synthetics, etc.). Both biogenic detritus and some of the anthropogenic particle emissions contain organic materials which have unique and distinguishable compound distribution patterns (C(14)-C(40)). Microbial and vascular plant lipids are the dominant biogenic residues and petroleum hydrocarbons, with lesser amounts of the pyrogenic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and synthetics (e.g., chlorinated compounds), are the major anthropogenic residues. Biomass combustion is another important primary source of particles injected into the global atmosphere. It contributes many trace substances which are reactants in atmospheric chemistry and soot paniculate matter with adsorbed biomarker compounds, most of which are unknown chemical structures. The injection of natural product organic compounds into smoke occurs primarily by direct volatilization/steam stripping and by thermal alteration based on combustion temperature. Although the molecular composition of organic matter in smoke particles is highly variable, the molecular tracers are generally still source specific. Retene has been utilized as a tracer for conifer smoke in urban aerosols, but is not always detectable. Dehydroabietic acid is generally more concentrated in the atmosphere from the same emission sources. Degradation products from biopolymers (e.g., levoglucosan from cellulose) are also excellent tracers. An overview of the biomarker compositions of biomass smoke types is presented here. Defining additional tracers of thermally-altered and directly-emitted natural products in smoke aids the assessment of the organic matter type and input from biomass combustion to aerosols. The precursor to product approach of compound characterization by organic geochemistry can be applied successfully to provide tracers for studying the chemistry and dispersion of ambient aerosols and smoke plumes."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"21","Month":"05","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"19009394"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0944-1344","MedlineTA":"Environ Sci Pollut Res Int","NlmUniqueID":"9441769","Country":"Germany"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1007/BF02987621","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"19009394","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"10","PubStatus":"received","Month":"10","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"30","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"11","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Conventional phases of ecological recovery (plant invasion and succession) have occurred, but the structure of the biodiverse plant community (51 species and 22 families) was different from that at a recovering non-polluted disturbed site. Three plant species (Bermuda grass, mulberry, and sunflower) believed to be early invaders of the basin still persist in large numbers indicating that these species are well suited to cope with normal environmental stresses at this area (i.e. seasonal drought and flood) as well as organic pollutants. There was an indication that early invaders of the site fostered disappearance of contaminants thereby creating more favorable conditions for a broader spectrum of plants to grow.

To test this, we surveyed reports on the ecological impacts of the cultivation of non-transgenic crop plants with novel or improved traits and, in three cases, investigated whether Annex II B would have been adequate to indicate the effects. Such an assessment appears to be feasible only if the time frame on which it is based is short, so that long-term effects cannot be assessed. Secondly, the plant must be genetically homogenous which is not always granted, e.g. with forest-trees. Thirdly, the cultivation area must be defined. Differences in the behaviour of foreign plants between their original and cultivation habitats may be ecologically relevant and should be assessed. In the (few) cases where direct inference of the observed effects was possible from inherent traits, these effects often correlated with poor adaptation to local environmental conditions. The ecological impacts of traits that had been introduced in order to overcome poor adaptation may differ widely according to the way in which the traits are exploited. In practice, the effects of agricultural measures are more important than the effects of gene transfer and invasiveness, although the latter currently play a major role in risk assessment.

When iron is exposed to the environment (e.g. as outdoor equipment, scrap, contamination in iron milled food or as iron meteorites) and corrodes, the iron phosphide present in the iron is suspended in the medium and can hydrolyze to phosphine.

It is derived from the litterbag technique and consists of polyethylene minicontainers (volume about 1.5 cm(3)) filled with a test substrate (litter, straw, cellulose, etc.). The minicontainers (MCs) are closed at either end with plastic gauze discs of variable mesh size (e.g. 20 microm, 250 microm, 500 microm or 2 mm). A definite number of such units are inserted into PVC-bars, which can be implanted into the soil horizontally or vertically, or be exposed on the soil surface horizontally. The bars are very stable and can be exposed in different environments for months to years. If required, the bars can be removed temporarily and stored, e.g. during soil cultivation. Should fresh litter be used, two phases of decomposition can be distinguished: a fast initial phase, which can be mainly related to the effect of leaching, and a second slow phase depending mainly on the activity of soil organisms and litter quality. Several questions can be addressed to investigations using MCs, e.g. 1) parts of the soil fauna which are involved in decomposition (nematodes, microarthropods, and smaller specimens of the macrofauna, e.g. enchytraeidae, diplopods and dipteran larvae) can be extracted from the litter substrate using a miniscale high gradient extractor, 2) the organic mass loss of litter can be determined, 3) microbial biomass (C(mic), N(mic)) can be assessed by fumigation extraction and 4) microbial activity (respiration) in the test substrate can also be assessed by use of standardised methods. Compared to litterbag studies, the larger number of small replicate units improves the statistical evaluation. Until today the Minicontainer-test has been applied in forestry and agriculture, e.g. studying the effects of liming, soil restoration and the application of insecticides, e.g. Diflubenzuron (Dimilin) and Btk (Bacillus thuringiensis var.kurstaki)."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"20","Month":"05","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"19005666"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0944-1344","MedlineTA":"Environ Sci Pollut Res Int","NlmUniqueID":"9441769","Country":"Germany"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1007/BF02987332","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"19005666","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"23","PubStatus":"received","Month":"11","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"28","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"4","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"14","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"14","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"14","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Our approach was to modify a continuously perfused bioreactor for cultivation and expansion of human hematopoietic stem cells. Therefore we immobilized stromal cells (human primary stromal cells or the murine cell line M2-10B4) in porous glass carriers in a fixed bed reactor and cocultivated human hematopoietic progenitor cells for several weeks. After inoculation of mononuclear cells derived from umbilical cord blood or peripheral blood stem cells both adherent and non adherent cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry and short-term colony assays. During cultivation there was a permanent production of progenitor cells and mature blood cells derived from the immobilized cells in the carriers. We could demonstrate the immobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells of the myeloid system detectable in short-term colony assays.

This paper describes a first investigation of displacement chromatography as a means to separate plasmid DNA (4.7 kb) from E. coli lipopolysaccharides and protein (holo transferrin), respectively. Displacement chromatography has advantages in this regard, since the substance mixture is resolved into rectangular zones of the individual components rather than into peaks. Thus a higher total concentration can be maintained in the pooled product fractions. Hydroxyapatite (type I and II) and anion exchange stationary phases were included in the experiments. In addition to a conventional anion exchange column packed with porous particles, the recently introduced continuous bed UNOTM anion exchange column was investigated. No DNA purification was possible with either hydroxyapatite material. Conventional particle based columns in general were not suited to the separation of any two substances varying considerably in molecular mass, e.g. plasmid DNA and standard protein. Presumably, the direct competition for the binding sites, which is essential in displacement chromatography, was restricted by the size dependency of the accessible stationary phase surface area in this case. Better results were obtained with the continuous bed column, in which the adsorptive surface coincides with the walls of the flow through pores. As a result the accessible surface does not vary as much with the size of the interacting molecules as for the conventional stationary phase materials. Sharper transitions were also observed between substance zones recovered from the UNOTM column. The steric mass action model was used to aid method development in case of the anion exchange approach. While further research in obviously necessary, displacement chromatography on continuous bed columns has been shown to be capable of separating plasmid DNA from typical impurities."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"07","Year":"2011"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"19003365"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0920-9069","MedlineTA":"Cytotechnology","NlmUniqueID":"8807027","Country":"Netherlands"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1023/A:1008091200262","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"19003365","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Inoculum size and initial conditioned medium concentration represent two important considerations for optimal batch production. Two hybridoma cell lines were used to assess the impact of these initial conditions on population growth and monoclonal antibody productivity in suspension batch culture. Varying initial cell concentration over the range of 1.0 x 105 cells mL-1 to 3.0 x 105 cells mL-1 did not affect maximum product titre or maximum volumetric cell-hours attained. Initial percent of conditioned medium up to 40 percent strongly impacted on population growth and productivity, with initial levels of 30 to 40% conditioned medium reducing or eliminating lag phase and increasing average viable cell density. However, specific productivity and product titre declined with increasing initial percent conditioned medium, even on a per volume of fresh medium basis. Glutamine and glucose depletion or ammonia toxicity could cause depressed product titres when conditioned medium is used. Glutamine and glucose levels can easily be replenished in conditioned medium at minimal cost, and ammonia can be removed. Specific productivity was higher during cyclic batch operating mode than during batch operating mode. This may be because cyclic batch operating mode results in an incidental volume of conditioned medium at the beginning of each cycle. A two stage, cyclic-batch/batch operating mode can be employed to fully utilize medium and maximize product titre."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"07","Year":"2011"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"19003332"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0920-9069","MedlineTA":"Cytotechnology","NlmUniqueID":"8807027","Country":"Netherlands"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1023/A:1008060802286","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"19003332","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

In such operations a large volume of medium is turned over each day, especially in the case where cell recycle, or perfusion cultivation, is practiced. In principle, the volumetric throughput of medium can be reduced by using a more concentrated feed while maintaining the same nutrient provision rate. Overall, the medium components are divided into two categories: 'consumable nutrients' and 'unconsumable inorganic bulk salts'. In such fortified medium, the concentrations of consumable nutrients, but not bulk salts, are increased. With a stoichiometrically-balanced medium, the large amount of nutrients fed into the culture is largely consumed by cells to give rise to residual concentrations of these nutrients in their optimal range. However, unless care is taken to initiate the continuous culture, overshoot of nutrients may occur during the transient period. The high nutrient concentration during overshoot may be inhibitory by itself, or the resulting high osmolality may retard the growth. Using a mathematical model that incorporates the growth inhibitory effect of high osmolality we demonstrate such a potentially catastrophic effect of nutrient and osmolality overshoot by simulation. To avoid overshoot a controlled nutrient feeding scheme should be devised at the initiation of continuous culture."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"07","Year":"2011"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"19003148"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0920-9069","MedlineTA":"Cytotechnology","NlmUniqueID":"8807027","Country":"Netherlands"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1023/A:1008026613975","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"19003148","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

We constructed alpha2M cDNAs with mutated DNA sequences in the bait region, and obtained recombinant CHO cell lines producing either wild type alpha2M, or mutant alpha2Ms, i.e., alpha2M/K692 and alpha2M/K696, each with substitution of Arg with Lys at codons 692 and 696, respectively. We tested if lysyl endopeptidase is not inhibited by wild type alpha2M, but could be inhibited by these engineered mutant alpha2Ms. Thus, recombinant alpha2M/K696 protein successfully inhibited lysyl endopeptidase activity, while recombinant alpha2M/K692 protein was not sensitive to lysyl endopeptidase, suggesting that not all bait region peptide bonds can equally be accessible and susceptible to proteinases.

Numerous efforts have been made to develop strategies for reversal and/or modulation of this major therapy obstacle through targeting at different levels of intervention. The phenomenon of MDR is often associated with overexpression of resistance-associated genes. Since the classical type of MDR in human cancers is mainly mediated by the P-glycoprotein encoded by the multidrug resistance gene 1, mdr1, the majority of reversal approaches target the expression and/or function of the mdr1 gene/P-glycoprotein. Due to the fact that the multidrug phenotype always represents the net effect of a panel of resistance-associated genes/gene products, other resistance genes, e.g. those encoding the multidrug resistance-associated protein MRP or the lung resistance protein LRP, were included in the studies. Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-2 have been shown to modulate the MDR phenotype in different experimental settings in vitro and in vivo. Several studies have been performed to evaluate their potential as chemosensitizers of tumor cells in the context of a combined application of MDR-associated anticancer drugs like doxorubicin and vincristine with cytokines. Moreover, the capability of cytokines to modulate the expression of MDR-associated genes was demonstrated, either by external addition or by transduction of the respective cytokine gene. Knowledge of the combination effects of cytokines and cytostatics and its link to their MDR-modulating capacity may contribute to a more efficient and to a more individualized immuno-chemotherapy of human malignancies."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"19002798"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0920-9069","MedlineTA":"Cytotechnology","NlmUniqueID":"8807027","Country":"Netherlands"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1023/A:1008089512856","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"19002798","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

In recent years, it has become apparent that DNA repair is an extremely complex process. Processes within DNA repair that may contribute to one or more drug resistance phenotypes include; O-6-alkyltransferase activity, base excision repair, mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and gene specific repair. Clearly, several of these processes may show increased activity within any single cell, or tumor, at any one time. This review attempts to touch briefly upon the question of the distinctions between each of these specific pathways; and then seeks to expand on nucleotide excision repair as a possible effector of cellular and clinical resistance to platinum-based anticancer therapy."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"19002792"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0920-9069","MedlineTA":"Cytotechnology","NlmUniqueID":"8807027","Country":"Netherlands"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1023/A:1008016922425","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"19002792","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

This article describes two important aspects, i.e., 1) a role of the MRP/GS-X pump in the modulation of cell cycle arrest induced by anticancer prostaglandins; 2) coordinated up-regulation of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase gamma-GCS) and MRP1 genes. The A and J series of prostaglandins (PGs) accumulate in the nuclei to suppress the proliferation of cancer cells. Delta(7)-Prostaglandin A(1) (Delta(7)-PGA(1)) methyl ester, a synthetic anticancer PG, increased the mRNA level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Sdi1/CIP1/WAF1) in human leukemia HL-60 cells. The induction of p21(Sdi1/CIP1/WAF1) was associated with the accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and the suppression of c-myc gene expression. Unlike HL-60 cells, cisplatin-resistant HL-60/R-CP cells were insensitive to Delta(7)-PGA(1) methyl ester. While c-myc expression was transiently suppressed, neither G1 arrest nor hypophosphorylation of pRB was observed with the anticancer PG. Plasma membrane vesicles from HL-60/R-CP cells showed an enhanced level of GS-X pump activity toward the glutathione S-conjugate of Delta(7)-PGA(1) methyl ester. GIF-0019, a potent inhibitor of the GS-X pump, dose-dependently enhanced the cellular sensitivity of HL-60/R-CP cells to Delta(7)-PGA(1) methyl ester, resulting in G1 arrest. The GS-X pump is suggested to play a pivotal role in modulating the biological action of the anticancer PG. The expression of MRP1 and gamma-GCS genes can be coordinately up-regulated by cisplatin, 1-[5-(4-amino-2-methyl)pyrimidyl]methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea (ACNU), and heavy metals in human cancer cells. For the up-regulation of these genes, both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations are considered to be involved."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"19002785"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0920-9069","MedlineTA":"Cytotechnology","NlmUniqueID":"8807027","Country":"Netherlands"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1023/A:1008036015156","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"19002785","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

In vivo studies were conducted by preparing stable transfectants of HeLa cells with wild-type MRP cDNA or MRP cDNAs which had been mutated at certain nucleotide binding domains (NBD). Stable transfectants producing equivalent amounts of the MRP encoded protein P190 were used in this study. The results demonstrated that deletions in the C-motif of NBD1 or the A-motif of NBD2 have a pronounced effect in reducing resistance levels to chemotherapeutic agents. Certain single-site mutations in lysines in these same motifs also reduce IC(50) values. It has also been observed that mutation of the MRP NBDs results in an increase in drug accumulation and a reduction in drug efflux. Additional studies have been carried out in which recombinant baculovirus containing either wild-type MRP or MRP containing mutated NBDs was prepared and used to infect SF21 insect cells. Using this system we have analyzed the effects of these mutations on in vitro transport of leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) 17 beta-estradiol 17 (beta-D-glucuronide)(E(2)17betaG) and daunomycin in membrane vesicles prepared from baculovirus infected cells. The results demonstrate that deletions and site-specific mutations in MRP NBDs greatly reduce the ATP dependent transport of all three substrates. The results of these studies conducted both in vivo and in vitro demonstrate that the NBDs of MRP function in a cooperative manner and are critical for the transport activity of the MRP encoded protein P190.

Cancer cells appear to have the capacity to generate variants resistant to any anticancer drug. Tumours, and even individual cancer cells, can exhibit multiple mechanisms of resistance simultaneously. In order to overcome resistance it may be necessary to achieve a high rate of tumour cell kill before multiple resistance mechanisms can develop, and/or to develop therapies which simultaneously target several resistance mechanisms. Mechanisms of resistance described so far include 'bulk' mechanisms (e.g. related to blood and drug supply, and to oxygenation), mechanisms relating to population cell kinetics, and mechanisms at the cellular level including altered expression of drug target proteins, drug transporter proteins, drug metabolising enzymes, and proteins which regulate cell death pathways. This volume brings together up-to-date reviews on all of these aspects written by researchers actively involved in their topic. It is a completely new book, different from its predecessor Multiple Drug Resistance in Cancer - Cellular, Molecular and Clinical Approaches (Kluwer, 1994). Most of the topics and contributors are new, and chapters on the same topics are included only in cases where there have been significant research developments in the interim period. I hope that this volume will bring together different ideas and approaches, and help to encourage their integration to generate new treatments which will cure more cancer patients."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"19002779"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0920-9069","MedlineTA":"Cytotechnology","NlmUniqueID":"8807027","Country":"Netherlands"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1023/A:1008029532700","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"19002779","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Such stress symptoms are usually unspecific - just like the mechanisms of stress avoidance or stress tolerance themselves. A stress model taking account of ecological, physiological and evolutionary aspects is presented; it is shown that the different stress phases are influenced by various factors, e.g. the photosynthetic capacity of the leaves. The stress reactions displayed by fumigated poplars serve as illustrations for this model. Different species of the genus Populus can be classified as more or less pure C-strategists.

The data indicated that a high level of conservation in the amino terminus was not required for the preservation of substrate selectivity. Analysis of glucuronidation activity encoded by UDPGTh1/UDPGTh2 chimeric cDNA constructed at their common restriction sites,Sac 1 (codon 297),Nco 1 (codon 385), andHha 1 (codon 469), showed that nine amino acids between residues 385 and 469 were important for catalytic efficiency, suggesting that this region represented a domain which was critical for the catalysis but distinct from that responsible for aglycone selection. These data indicate, that UDPGTh2 is a primary isoform responsible for the detoxification of the bile salt intermediate as well as the active estrogen intermediates."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18982489"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0253-6269","MedlineTA":"Arch Pharm Res","NlmUniqueID":"8000036","Country":"Korea (South)"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1007/BF02973939","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18982489","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"23","PubStatus":"received","Month":"6","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The DSTD measures the differential pressure as a function of time across the liquid-air interface of growing drops that repeatedly form and detach at the end of a capillary tip. The calibration technique utilizes the ratio of pressure signals acquired from the drop growth of two separate solutions, i.e. a standard solution and a corresponding mobile phase, such as water, both of which have a known surface tension. Once calibrated, the dynamic surface tension of an analyte is obtained from the ratio of the pressure signals from the analyte solution to that of the mobile phase solution. Thus, this calibration technique eliminates the need to optically image the radius of the expanding drop of liquid. Accurate dynamic surface tension determinations were achieved for aqueous sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solutions over a concentration range of 0.5-5.4 mM. The measured surface tensions for these SDS solutions range from 70.3 to 46.8 dyne/cm and were in excellent agreement with the literature. A precision of 0.2 dyne/cm (1 S.D.) was routinely obtained. Second, the DSTD with this calibration technique was combined with flow injection analysis (FIA) for the study of model protein solutions and polymer solutions. The kinetic surface tension behavior of aqueous bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions as a function of concentration and flow rate is presented. Evaluation of the dynamic surface tension data illustrates that a protein such as BSA initially exhibits kinetically-hindered surface tension lowering, i.e. a time dependence, as BSA interacts with the liquid-air interface of an expanding drop. FIA/DSTD is then shown to be an effective tool for the rapid study of kinetically-hindered surfactant mixtures. It was found that mixtures of SDS and the polymeric surfactant Brij(R)-35 (lauryl polyoxyethylene ether with an average molecular weight of 1200 g/mol) result in essentially an additive lowering of the surface tension. Mixtures of polyethylene glycol (PEG), with an average molecular weight of 1470 g/mol, and Brij(R)-35, however, result in a competitive (non-additive) surface tension with the Brij(R)-35 dominating the response."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18967799"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0039-9140","MedlineTA":"Talanta","NlmUniqueID":"2984816R","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0039-9140(99)00210-6","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18967799","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"12","PubStatus":"received","Month":"4","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"30","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"6","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"1","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"7","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The anodic peak potential (E(pa)) and peak current (I(pa)) were found to be remarkably dependent on the charge and the concentration of the surfactant. The E(pa) and I(pa) change abruptly around the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of the surfactants and reach a plateau above the CMC. The E(pa) at the plateau shifts to more positive values in the cationic CTAB micellar solution, e.g. from 180 mV vs SCE in aqueous solution at pH 6.8 to 410 mV in CTAB micelle, whilst it shifts to less positive values in the anionic SDS micellar solution, e.g. 150 mV at pH 6.8. Therefore, the overlapped anodic peaks of dopamine and ascorbic acid in the mixture of the two compounds in aqueous solutions can be separated in CTAB micelles since the micelle shifts the E(pa) of ascorbic acid to less positive values. The two peaks are separated by ca. 400 mV at pH 6.8 in CTAB micelle, hence dopamine can be determined in the presence of 100 times excess of ascorbic acid. In SDS micelle and in the presence of ascorbic acid, the I(pa) of dopamine is greatly enhanced due to the catalytic oxidation of the latter that enables quantitative determination of both compounds."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18967797"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0039-9140","MedlineTA":"Talanta","NlmUniqueID":"2984816R","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0039-9140(99)00207-6","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18967797","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"23","PubStatus":"received","Month":"11","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"24","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"6","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"29","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"6","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Separations were performed at ambient temperature, simplifying instrumental requirements. Excellent separation efficiency using a water mobile phase was achieved, for example N=18 800, or 75 200 m(-1), was obtained for resorcinol, at a retention factor of k'=4.88 (retention time of 9.55 min at 1 ml min(-1) for a 25 cmx4.6 mm i.d. column, packed with 5 mum diameter particles with the cyano propyl stationary phase). A separation via reversed phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) with a 100% water mobile phase of six phenols and related compounds was compared to a separation of the same compounds by traditional RP-LC, using octadecylsilane (ODS), i.e. C18, bound to silica and an aqueous mobile phase modified with acetonitrile. Nearly identical analysis time was achieved for the separation of six phenols and related compounds using the cyano propyl stationary phase with a 100% water mobile phase, as compared to traditional RP-LC requiring a relatively large fraction of organic solvent modifier in the mobile phase (25% acetonitrile:75% water). Additional understanding of the retention mechanism with the 100% water mobile phase was obtained by relating measured retention factors of aliphatic alcohols, phenols and related compounds, and chlorinated hydrocarbons to their octanol:water partition coefficients. The retention mechanism is found to be consistent with a RP-LC mechanism coupled with an additional retention effect due to residual hydroxyl groups on the cyano propyl stationary phase. Advantages due to a 100% water mobile phase for the chemical analysis of alcohol mixtures and chlorinated hydrocarbons are reported. By placing an absorbance detector in-series and preceding a novel drop interface to a flame ionization detector (FID), selective detection of a separated mixture of phenols and related compounds and aliphatic alcohols is achieved. The compound class of aliphatic alcohols is selectively and sensitively detected by the drop interface/FID, and the phenols and related compounds are selectively and sensitively detected by absorbance detection at 200 nm. The separation and detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons in a water sample matrix further illustrated the advantages of this methodology. The sensitivity and selectivity of the FID signal for the chlorinated hydrocarbons are significantly better than absorbance detection, even at 200 nm. This methodology is well suited to continuous and automated monitoring of water samples. The applicability of samples initially in an organic solvent matrix is explored, since an organic sample matrix may effect retention and efficiency. Separations in acetonitrile and isopropyl alcohol sample matrices compared well to separations with a water sample matrix."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18967746"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0039-9140","MedlineTA":"Talanta","NlmUniqueID":"2984816R","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0039-9140(99)00149-6","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18967746","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","PubStatus":"received","Month":"1","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"28","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"4","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

While the chromate anion band retains its wavenumber along the full compositional range, the sulfate anion band is shifted toward lower wavenumbers with decrease in the corresponding mole fraction.

A selective retention of either Se(IV) or Se(IV) plus Se(VI) can be carried out by using the uptake system made up of either Pseudomonas putida or Escherichia coli strains cultivated in a culture medium based on glucose (P. putida) and glucose plus dipotassium phosphate (E. coli) mixed together with the original sample solution containing the selenium species. Discrimination between inorganic selenium species is possible by combining the optimization of the bacterial cell, the growth conditions and the relative rates of their retention from the sample. In the general procedure, an equilibrium between the analyte in the solution and the uptake system is allowed to be established, and then the concentration of selenium is determined directly in the biomass by slurry sampling ETAAS. Nonetheless, a theoretical model is proposed to describe the retention process by the living bacterial cells, which also provides a feasible quantification of the extraction process before the adsorption equilibrium is reached and whenever the agitation conditions and the sampling time are under control. The detection limits for the inorganic selenium species at the best retention conditions are of 5.7 ng Se(IV) ml(-1) for P. putida and 6.1 ng Se(IV) ml(-1) and 6.3 ng Se(VI) ml(-1) for E. coli.

This study attempt to implement some analytical guideline for the raw materials in order to improve the final product. Three types of raw materials obtained in different quarries have been characterised by means of chemical analysis with electron microprobe, powder X-ray diffraction and FT-Raman spectroscopy. The main difference between the clays studied is the carbonate content: one of the analysed samples is deficient in this component, while it is present as calcite (8%) or as calcite (14%) plus dolomite (10%) in the rest. The observed compositional differences seem to be relevant in the firing process. FT-Raman spectra reveal the onset of early vitrification (at about 900 degrees C) in the sample without carbonate. The importance of calcium and magnesium oxides, obtained from the corresponding carbonates, for the synthesis of new mineral phases that could slow down the vitrification process is discussed."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18967720"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0039-9140","MedlineTA":"Talanta","NlmUniqueID":"2984816R","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0039-9140(99)00031-4","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18967720","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"7","PubStatus":"received","Month":"9","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"13","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"11","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"16","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"11","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

In particular, on-line measurements are of interest to increase process stability and to document constant product quality. Application to polymer processing e.g. polymer extrusion, could even increase product quality. Interesting parameters are composition of the processed polymer, moisture, or reaction status in reactive extrusion. For this issue a transmission sensor was developed for application of NIR spectroscopy to extrusion processes. This sensor includes fibre optic probes and a measuring cell to be adapted to various extruders for in-line measurements. In contrast to infrared sensors, it only uses optical quartz components. Extrusion processes at temperatures up to 300 degrees C and pressures up to 37 MPa have been investigated. Application of multivariate data analysis (e.g. partial least squares, PLS) demonstrated the performance of the system with respect to process monitoring: in the case of polymer blending, deviations between predicted and actual polymer composition were quite low (in the range of +/-0.25%). So the complete system is suitable for harsh industrial environments and could lead to improved polymer extrusion processes."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18967719"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0039-9140","MedlineTA":"Talanta","NlmUniqueID":"2984816R","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0039-9140(99)00035-1","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18967719","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"7","PubStatus":"received","Month":"9","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"9","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"11","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"10","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"11","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The K(ex) values were analyzed into the constituent equilibrium constants, i.e. the extraction constant of picric acid, the distribution constant of the crown ether, the formation constant of the metal ion-crown ether complex in water, and the ion-pair extraction constant of the complex cation with the picrate anion. The effects of an extra methylene group of 19C6 on the extraction ability and selectivity are discussed in detail by comparing the constituent equilibrium constants of 19C6 with those of 18-crown-6 (18C6). The K(ex) value of 19C6 for each metal ion is lower than that of 18C6, which is mostly attributed to the higher lipophilicity of 19C6. The extraction ability of 19C6 for the univalent metal ions decreases in the order Tl(+)>K(+)>Rb(+)>Ag(+)>Cs(+)>Na(+)Li(+), which is the same as that observed for 18C6. The difference in logK(ex) between the univalent metals is generally smaller for 19C6 than for 18C6.

For this purpose chemically modified electrodes (CME's) were constructed from glassy carbon coated with dimethylglyoxime-containing polymers. CME's based on a composite matrix, which contained polyvinyl chloride, polyaniline, and dimethylglyoxime were shown to possess the ability to accumulate traces of nickel(II) from ammonia buffered aquatic solutions by a purely chemical attachment. Moreover the nickel(II) contents of such solutions could be determined using voltammetric quantitation of the nickel(II) dimethylglyoximate deposits on the CME surfaces and the standard addition technique. The CME surfaces could subsequently be regenerated by acid treatment. The limit of detection for Ni(II) following a 240 s chemical deposition was estimated as 18 mug Ni l(-1), and the CME results for traces of Ni(II) in fresh water compared well with the results obtained by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Moreover the CME's retained their sensitivity for more than two days, i.e. significantly longer than the 3 h, during which analogous carbon paste electrodes completely lost their affinity to nickel(II)."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18967641"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0039-9140","MedlineTA":"Talanta","NlmUniqueID":"2984816R","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0039-9140(99)00055-7","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18967641","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"17","PubStatus":"received","Month":"11","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"1","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"2","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"2","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"2","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

On the other hand, both the size of the cavity and the reactivity of beta-CDs are altered when the hydroxy groups are substituted. As best models, the interactions among hydroxypropylated CDs of different average degree (and pattern) of substitution (DS) and phenolphthalein (as a model for 'large' guests) or p-nitrophenol/p-nitrophenolate (p-NP/p-NPate) couple (as for 'small' ones) have been studied. The formation constants of phenolphthalein-hydroxypropyl-beta-CD (HP-CD) complexes are continuously decreasing, while those of p-NP and p-NPate ones show a maximum with increasing DS. Similarly, the pattern of substitution has a significant effect on the quality of the interaction, too. The change of the DS on O(6) position alters the type of the interactions most, and a series of different findings prove that this change is the basis in the chiral selectivity of different CD derivatives, too.

Plots of the absorbance and fluorescence maxima versus the E(T)(30) solvent parameter showed linear relationships in binary mixtures of protic-protic (methanol-H(2)O) and aprotic-protic (DMSO-H(2)O) solvents. Aggregation was indicated by a broad band in the ground state absorption spectra and a low quantum efficiency 0.04 relative to the efficiency observed in organic solvents. A face-to-face conformation of the monomeric subunits of the dimer is suggested due to the red-shifted absorbance band. The acid-base properties of the dye were studied and were indicative of a multi-step process. In acidic conditions (pH 1), protonation of the bridging nitrogen atoms was identified by a broad band appearing red-shifted to those obtained at higher pH values. Under slightly acidic conditions a pKa value of 6.7 was determined for one of the meso-nitrogen. In alkaline conditions a pKa of 11.5 was determined for another meso-nitrogen and a second fluorescence band emerged at 804 nm, red-shifted to the emission maxima."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18967536"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0039-9140","MedlineTA":"Talanta","NlmUniqueID":"2984816R","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0039-9140(98)00299-9","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18967536","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"2","PubStatus":"received","Month":"9","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"16","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"9","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"17","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"9","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Their determinations are based on the enhancement of colour intensity of the Fe(III)-SCN(-) complex. The value of apparent molar absorptivity of the Fe(III)-SCN(-)-CS(+) complexes in the terms of CS lie in the range of (2.10-4.30)x10(3) l mol(-1) cm(-1) at absorption maximum 475 nm. The most sensitive surfactant, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) imparted detection limit (absorbance >3 s) of 250 ppb CPC has been selected for the detailed studies. The working range is linear over 0.5-30.0 ppm CPC with slope, intercept, correlation coefficient and sample throughput of 0.67, 0.02, +0.99 and 100 samples h(-1), respectively. The effect of analytical and FIA variables on the determination of the surfactant and the composition of the complex are discussed. The method is free from interferences of almost all ions which commonly associated with the surfactant in the environmental samples. The analytical potentiality i.e. sensitivity, linearity, precision and optimal analytical conditions of FIA to the manual system for the determination of the surfactant are compared.

After the exposure of the sample to microwave radiation, the analyte was subject to a precipitation/dissolution process. Bismuth was precipitated with the stannite ion in basic medium and collected on the walls of a knotted coil, while the other matrix components flowed downstream to waste. The precipitate was dissolved with nitric acid and a sub-sample was collected in a capillary of a sampling arm assembly, to introduce 20 mul volumes into the graphite tube by means of positive displacement with air through a time-based injector. The analytical figures of merit were first evaluated by filling the sampling arm with a standard solution of bismuth and thereafter injecting aliquots of this solution into the atomizer. The calibration graph was linear from the detection limit (8 pg) to 1.2 ng of bismuth. The sensitivity was of 26.8 mug l(-1) for 0.2 A-s and the characteristic mass (m(o)) was of 11.8 pg/0.0044 A-s.

Soil samples were suspended in solvent and the SPME fibre suspended in the headspace above the slurry. Finally, the fibre was desorbed in the Gas Chromatograph (GC) injection port and the analysis of the samples was carried out. Since the transfer of contaminants from the soil to the SPME fibre involves four separate phases (soil-solvent-headspace and fibre coating), parameters affecting the distribution of the analytes were investigated. Using a well-aged artificially spiked garden soil, different solvents (both organic and aqueous) were used to enhance the release of the contaminants from the solid matrix to the headspace. It was found that simple addition of water is adequate for the purpose of analysing the target volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in soil. The addition of 1 ml of water to 1 g of soil yielded maximum response. Without water addition, the target VOCs were almost not released from the matrix and a poor response was observed. The effect of headspace volume on response as well as the addition of salt were also investigated. Comparison studies between conventional static headspace (HS) at high temperature (95 degrees C) and the new technology HSSPME at room temperature ( approximately 20 degrees C) were performed. The results obtained with both techniques were in good agreement. HSSPME precision and linearity were found to be better than automated headspace method and HSSPME also produced a significant enhancement in response. The detection and quantification limits for the target VOCs in soils were in the sub-ng g(-1) level. Finally, we tried to extend the applicability of the method to the analysis of semivolatiles. For these studies, two natural soils contaminated with diesel fuel and wood preservative, as well as a standard urban dust contaminated with polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were tested. Discrimination in the response for the heaviest compounds studied was clearly observed, due to the poor partition in the headspace and to the slow kinetics of all the processes involved in HSSPME."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18967484"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0039-9140","MedlineTA":"Talanta","NlmUniqueID":"2984816R","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0039-9140(98)00263-X","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18967484","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"3","PubStatus":"received","Month":"4","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"10","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"7","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"3","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"8","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Two plasticizers (NPOE and NPBnE) were studied. The new 14-crown-formazan 4a containing the 4-pyridyl N-oxide at the formazyl carbon exhibited the highest selectivity in cesium ion selective electrodes, especially towards the two low selectivity monovalent ions K(+) and NH4(+). Also, membranes containing the plasticizer NPBnE showed better cesium selectivity relative to most ions than those containing NPOE. Membranes containing 4a and variable compositions of plasticizers, potassium tetrakis-(p-chlorophenyl)borate (KTpClPB), and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) were studied in order to prepare an electrode with the optimum cesium selectivity. The highest selectivity for cesium was achieved with the two electrodes designated d and e with membranes containing the ionophore 4a, NPBnE and KTpClPB with and without TOPO.

The catalytic characteristics of this mimic-enzyme catalyst in the oxidation reaction of ascorbic acid with hydrogen peroxide has been studied. The experimental results showed that this peroxidase model compound has similar catalytic activity that of HRP. The catalytic activity of Fe(III)-HNT has been compared with those of HRP and common mimic-enzymes, metalloporphyrins (e.g. metal tetrakis(sulphophenyl)porphyrin (Me-TPPS(4))). Though the catalytic activity of Fe(III)-HNT is 75% of that of HRP, it can be used as a new kind of mimic-enzyme catalyst in determination of trace H(2)O(2). By coupling this mimetic catalytic reaction with the catalytic reaction of glucose oxidase, glucose can be determined indirectly.

The system was assembled with a three electrode screen-printed element (graphite as working electrode, silver as counter and silver, silver chloride as reference electrode) placed in a flow cell, a sample injection valve and two enzyme reactors. The determination of the total amount of HxR and Hx is realized by flowing the sample through two reactors in series: one reactor was packed with nucleoside phosphorylase (Np) and the other with xanthine oxidase (XO) immobilized on aminopropyl glass. Similarly, the other term of the equation was evaluated by flowing through the two reactors the sample treated by Alkaline phosphatase (AlP) for 5-10 min at 45 degrees C. One assay could be completed within 5 min. The system for the determination of fish freshness was reproducible within 2-3% (n=4). The immobilized enzymes were fairly stable for at least 3 months at 4 degrees C. More than 200-300 samples could be analyzed in about one month by using these enzyme reactors provided the disposable screen-printed electrode should be changed every 30-40 real samples. The results obtained suggest that the proposed sensor system provides a simple, rapid and economical method for the determination of fish freshness (K). We applied the present system with two reactors for the determination of K values in fish samples and compared the results with those obtained by the XO-reactor. Correlation factor and regression line between the two methods were 0.992 and Y=-3.14+1.03X respectively.

Finally, SEP was applied to the Ortigas river sediments, showing that most of the elements were found mainly associated with the residual sediment fraction, except for uranium, which was found as an exchangeable species in approximately 60% of its total content.

The method is based on nitrite determination using the diazotization-coupling reaction by column preconcentration and on the reduction of nitrate to nitrite using the Cd-Cu reductor column. Nitrite is diazotized with sulfanilamide (SAM) in the pH range 2.0-5.0, sulfamethizole (SM) in pH 1.8-5.6 and sulfadimidine (SD) in pH 1.8-4.0 in a hydrochloric acid medium to form water-soluble colourless diazonium cations. These cations were coupled with sodium 1-naphthol-4-sulfonate (NS) in the pH range 9.0-12.0 for the SAM-NS system, pH 8.6-12.0 for the SM-NS system and pH 9.4-12.0 for the SD-NS system to be retained on naphthalene-tetradecyldimethylbenzylammonium (TDBA)-iodide (I) adsorbent packed in a column. The solid mass is dissolved out from the column with 5 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) and the absorbance is measured by a spectrophotometer at 543 nm for SAM-NS, 537 nm for SM-NS and 530 nm for SD-NS. The calibration graph was linear over 30-600 ng NO(2)-N and 22-450 ng NO(3)-N in 15 ml of final aqueous solution (i.e. 2-40 ng NO(2)-N ml(-1) and 1.5-30 ng NO(3)-N ml(-1) in aqueous sample) for three systems.

The benefits of superheated water extraction-EIA includes replacement of harmful organic solvents used in extraction, fast extractions (15-30 min.) with an inexpensive extractant, reduced number of steps in the determination of the target compounds, and the application of sensitive and relatively inexpensive assays. Further advantages of the superheated water extraction are higher extraction efficiencies compared with the methanol based extraction kits associated with the EIA and direct measurement of the extracts with EIA.

Research programmes were conducted on their interpretation in order to develop tools for the evaluation of long term release of pollutants contained in solidified wastes. Models for the leaching of porous materials are discussed in this paper according to the specificity of the chemical species (i.e. transport model with total dissolution of species-diffusional model; transport model with progressive dissolution of species due to limitation of solubility-shrinking core model; and the model coupling transport and chemical phenomena). The leaching behaviour of pollutants (i.e. lead) solidified in a cement matrix was studied under different chemical conditions. Results have shown that the release of species whose solubilities depend on the physico-chemical conditions, and especially the pH (e.g. amphoteric metals), is governed by the solubility of the species in the pore water at local conditions and by the pH evolution within the matrix. A coupled dissolution/diffusion model was developed to describe the release of chemically complex species contained in a porous medium in contact with water. Leaching tests of cement matrices and artificial porous matrices containing calcium hydroxide and pollutants were conducted in order to validate the coupled dissolution/diffusion model. A good assessment of the retention of some pollutants contained in cement matrices could then be obtained by the association of two tests: solubilization of the pollutants related to the chemical context (pH) under steady state conditions and monolithic long term dynamic leaching tests in order to characterize the evolution of the chemical context (pH) and consequently the release of pollutants. The objective is to integrate this approach in the standardization process (CEN TC 292- WG 6, in progress)."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"16","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18967159"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0039-9140","MedlineTA":"Talanta","NlmUniqueID":"2984816R","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0039-9140(97)00405-0","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18967159","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","PubStatus":"received","Month":"5","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"14","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"10","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The Dutch quick leaching test proposal in which the wetting time of the test specimen is reduced by applying vacuum was chosen as a starting point. The influence of the following parameters were studied: vacuum, stirring, open or closed vessel, water renewal frequency, leachant quality and laboratory or batch differences. The study was performed with test specimens prepared from a cement stabilised soil containing As, Cr and Cu. The test specimens were immersed in water and the water was renewed at certain time intervals. The study clearly showed that the use of vacuum had a strong effect on the release rate and that the open vessel lowered the pH-values of the eluates due to uptake of carbon dioxide in the water. The results also indicate higher emissions when stirring was applied.

The results demonstrate that the turnover of metallothionein is tissue dependent. Metallothionein has an estimated half-life of 69 and 160 days in the gills and kidney, respectively. The half-life could not be calculated for metallothionein in the digestive gland and is probably much longer than the other two tissues. Cadmium elimination from the gill and kidney is considerably slower than the respective metallothioneins (half-life in excess of 300 days) indicating closed cycling of the metal in these tissues. In contrast, cadmium levels in the digestive gland continue to increase during the detoxification period reflecting some remobilization from other tissues. Metallothionein turnover is extremely slow in Littorina when compared with mammals and other bivalve molluscs: even though metallothionein degradation is measurable in some gastropod tissues, the released cadmium may induce de novo metallothionein synthesis to which cadmium becomes resequestered. The slow metallothionein turnover rates and the lack of significant cadmium excretion testify to the relatively stable nature of the cadmium-metallothionein complex in this invertebrate."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18967152"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0039-9140","MedlineTA":"Talanta","NlmUniqueID":"2984816R","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0039-9140(97)00344-5","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18967152","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","PubStatus":"received","Month":"11","Year":"1996"},{"Day":"3","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"3","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"4","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"3","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The xanthate formed is subsequently treated with potassium iodate and N-chlorosuccinimide, during which free iodine is liberated. Crystal violet dye was formed through selective oxidation of leuco crystal violet by liberated iodine, which has an absorbance maxima at 595 nm.

The high initial rate of the complex formation required the use of stopped-flow mixing technique in order to make kinetic measurements which, in addition, allows the method to be automated. Its analytical features compare very favourably with those described by using solid-surface room temperature phosphorescence in terms of rapidity, precision and selectivity. The initial rate is obtained within only 0.2 s after the reactants are mixed, which allows ready application of the proposed method to routine analyses.

Detection of the six common apo-E genotypes is based on the restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) arising from the abolition or creation of HhaI restriction sites within an amplified target DNA sequence of the apo-E gene. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes, a 230 bp target sequence within the apo-E gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and digested with HhaI, and the restricted DNA fragments separated by capillary electrophoresis (CE). This was performed on the BioFocustrade mark 3000 automated CE system equipped with an experimental laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detector (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), using capillaries (27 cm length, 75 mum i.d.) coated internally with polyaminoacryloylethoxyethanol. The analysis buffer (2xTris borate-EDTA, pH 8.3) was supplemented with a proprietary sieving polymer and 0.05 muM thiazole orange six. Samples were injected electrophoretically. Separations were carried out at 40 degrees C under constant voltage, and the emitted fluorescence detected at 515 nm. Restriction fragment lengths of the cleaved PCR products were estimated from the migration times, with a 20/100 bp ladder (Bio-Rad Laboratories 20/100 bp molecular ruler) serving as reference. Six different reproducible patterns were obtained for the six common apo-E genotypes, with good resolution of the component restriction fragments. The calculated sizes of the separated peaks closely corresponded with the predicted restricted fragment lengths for each specific genotype. We believe this is the first published report demonstrating the feasibility of automating the post-PCR detection of the apo-E RFLPs(2). This methodology overcomes the most labour-intensive step in apo-E genotyping, thus making it amenable to routine clinical application."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18967049"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0039-9140","MedlineTA":"Talanta","NlmUniqueID":"2984816R","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0039-9140(97)00286-5","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18967049","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"10","PubStatus":"received","Month":"4","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"21","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"7","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"23","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"7","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The cells were transformed using a firefly luciferase encoding plasmid with a tetracycline inducible promoter. Luciferase synthesis was induced in E. coli cells containing multiple copies of this plasmid by different levels of tetracycline in the growth media. The level of induction was determined by measuring the velocity of luciferase enzyme per absorbance unit of the injected culture. The micro-volume ByT-FAS instrumentation permitted the rapid determination of the level of induced luciferase and was significantly faster than the traditional quantitative determination of genetic transcription levels. The micro-volume ByT-FAS assays also used significantly lower amounts of the expensive substrate luciferin. This is the first reported use of ByT-FAS for the detection and analyses of transformed cells.

These transformed, gaseous analytes permeate through a PTFE membrane into an acceptor stream comprising of a tris-buffer. The continuously flowing acceptor stream is led into an injector forming an integrated part of a flow injection analysis (FIA) system. The sample receiving carrier stream in the FIA system, a chromate buffer, brings the sample, 50 mul, to the FIA-CE interface into which one end of a separation capillary has been inserted. A small portion of the injected sample enters the capillary (electrokinetic injection) and separation takes place. A UV detector is placed at the other capillary end and a run potential of 25 kV is applied to two platinum electrodes positioned in the flow system. Multiple sample injections can be performed in one uninterrupted electrophoretic run. A typical sampling frequency is 15 h(-1); each run may result in quantitation of at least five anions. The overall repeatability is in the range 1.8-3.6% (RSD). The technique has been applied to the analysis of real samples such as soft drinks, vinegar and wine.

A simple model was employed to characterize the equilibria, which is of help also if the exact composition of the immunoreagents is not known, and allows to predict the shape and position of the competition curve. The factors which determine the dynamic range were found to be the affinity constant the complex in the solid and the amount of antigen in the solid, and the affinity constant of the complex in solution phase. Useful aspects of the antigen-antibody complexation equilibria in the solid phase were investigated by ELISA at zero concentration of antigen in solution, obtaining c (s)c ( *) and K'f(n)(T).

Samples were collected on charcoal traps using the CLSA method. Analyses were performed with a GC-EAD-FID setup as well as a GC-MS system. The experiments revealed that several groups of compounds are perceptible to the Colorado potato beetle. The ability of the Colorado potato beetle to detect green leaf odours (e.g. (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and (E)-2-hexenal), linalool and some terpenes has been noticed before [Visser et al., J. Chem.

The theory's principle is based on the measurement of the change in electrode charge density as a result of protonated or unprotonated sulfide adsorbed on the electrode surface. This charge density is related to the potential. Connection of each individual capacitor in series amplifies the potential according to the equation, E(total)=E(1)+E(2)+E(3)+cdots, three dots, centeredE(n). As the charges of individual capacitors are concentrated to one capacitor area, the charge density rises, and the potential increases.

Because of the low level of arsenic species in real samples, many problems related with its speciation remain unresolved: species instability during sampling, storage and sample treatment, incomplete recovery of all species, matrix interferences, lack of appropriate certified reference materials and of sensitive analytical methods, etc. These aspects are underlined in this paper. The continued development of new analytical procedures pretending to solve some of these problems claim for an up-to-date knowledge of the recent publications. Therefore, this paper pretends to review the latest publications on the chemical speciation of arsenic, emphasizing the increasing activity in the development of accurate and precise analytical methods. In most of the cases, separation and preconcentration is necessary, followed by element-specific detection for sensitivity improvement. Hydride generation following separation procedures (e.g., ion-exchange or high performance liquid chromatography) coupled to atomic absorption or atomic emission detectors proved to have sufficient sensitivity to monitor arsenic exposure, although restricts the analysis to hydride-forming species. Modified procedures including some kind of heating in the presence of highly oxidizing agents have proved successful to completely decompose the arsenic containing compounds to arsenate and so to extend the range of compounds which can be determined by these methods. On-line arrangements have the additional advantage of avoiding excessive sample handling, although some of them involve numerous steps and others are too costly to be recommended for routine use. The analytical figures of merits, specially detection limits are given for most of the methods in order to afford comparison and judge possible applicability. These studies, which have been approached in many different ways, would lead to knowledge that are determinant in the understanding of the cycle of this element in environment and of its physiological and toxicological behavior in the living organisms."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18966898"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0039-9140","MedlineTA":"Talanta","NlmUniqueID":"2984816R","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0039-9140(97)00064-7","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18966898","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"16","PubStatus":"received","Month":"8","Year":"1996"},{"Day":"18","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"2","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"20","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"2","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"31","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

It is based on anodic oxidation at +700 mV of hydrogen peroxide with a platinum electrode covered with a gas permeable membrane. Glucose reacts with glucose oxidase immobilised on the external side of the membrane, and forms hydrogen peroxide which is able to cross the gas permeable membrane due to its high vapour tension, while other electroactive substances that are important interferents are completely blocked. This principle was discovered several years ago but no practical application was presented up to now. Therefore in this work a number of different commercial membranes were tested, in order to obtain a resistant, rapidly responding and interference free sensor to be used in conjunction with a blood gas measurement apparatus. Coimmobilisation of glucose oxidase and catalase was found to be useful for fast response and recovery of the electrode. Using some of the tested membranes, the linearity range is 1-15 mM, CV 5%, response time 90 s, recovery time for the next sample 120 s.

Clonal lineages recently introduced into the United States (US-7 and US-8) are more common now than the previously dominant lineage (US-1). To help determine why these changes occurred, four clonal lineages of P. in-festans common during the early 1990s in the United States and Canada were evaluated for sensitivity to the protectant fungicides mancozeb and chlorothalonil using amended agar assays for isolates collected from 1990 to 1994. No isolate or lineage was resistant to either mancozeb or chlorothalonil. There were significant differences among isolates for degree of sensitivity to one fungicide individually, but there were no significant (P = 0.05) differences among the US-1, US-6, US-7, and US-8 clonal lineages for degree of sensitivity to both fungicides. Therefore, resistance to protectant fungicides cannot explain the rapid increase in frequency of the US-7 and US-8 clonal lineages. Three components of pathogenic fitness (latent period, lesion area, and sporulation after 96 h) were tested for the three clonal lineages that were detected most commonly during 1994 (US-1, US-7, and US-8). All but one of the isolates in this analysis were collected during 1994 and evaluated within 10 months of collection by inoculating detached leaflets of the susceptible potato cultivar Norchip. There were significant differences between the US-1 and US-8 clonal lineages for lesion area and sporulation, and between US-1 and US-7 for latent period. The US-6 clonal lineage was excluded from the pathogenic fitness experiments, because no isolates of this lineage were collected during 1994. Compared with US-7 and US-8, US-1 had the longest latent period and the smallest lesions with the least sporulation. Incorporation of the differences between US-1 and US-8 in computer simulation experiments revealed that significantly more protectant fungicide (e.g., 25%) would be required to suppress epidemics caused by the US-8 clonal lineage compared with US-1. These differences in pathogenic fitness components probably contribute to the general predominance of the \"new\" clonal lineages (especially US-8) relative to the \"old\" US-1 lineage."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18945070"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0031-949X","MedlineTA":"Phytopathology","NlmUniqueID":"9427222","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1094/PHYTO.1997.87.9.973","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18945070","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

There was an inverse linear relationship between temperature and infection efficiency as indicated by the slope (-5.73) of the regression line relating the number of pustules per leaf to increasing temperatures between 17.5 and 28 degrees C.

Inoculated alfalfa plants exposed to constant temperatures of 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, or 30 degrees C after an initial 24-h leaf wetness period (19 degrees C) did not significantly affect infection efficiency (P </= 0.05), but did affect the time (from inoculation to the time when 50% of the pustules (T(50)) were visible (i.e., latent period). Using this state variable definition, latent period was found to decrease with increasing temperature. When latent period was measured as a rate variable, the rate of pustule appearance (as affected by temperature) was best described by the Gompertz model. Thus, temperature and length of the initial leaf wetness period had a greater impact on infection efficiency than did postinfection (post-leaf wetness) temperatures, whereas increasing temperatures from 15 to 30 degrees C had a significant effect on shortening the latent period (T(50)) and increasing the rate of pustule appearance."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18945066"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0031-949X","MedlineTA":"Phytopathology","NlmUniqueID":"9427222","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1094/PHYTO.1997.87.9.946","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18945066","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Initial seed grow-out tests and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay studies indicated that CMV was present in this seed lot at a level of nearly 15%. To verify these results and gain insight into the mechanism of seed transmission, four combinations of crosses between healthy and/or infected parent plants were conducted. None of the spinach seedlings derived from crossing healthy male and healthy female plants contained CMV, whereas a portion of seedlings derived from all of the other three crosses, i.e., healthy male and infected female, infected male and healthy female, and infected male and infected female plants, were infected with CMV. The results demonstrate that CMV is seed transmitted in spinach and indicate that both male and female parent plants can serve as infection sources. Ultrastructural studies, including immunogold labeling, revealed the presence of virus particles in the cytoplasm of ovary wall cells, ovule integuments and nucellus, anther, and seed-coat cells, as well as fine fibril-containing vesicles and electron-dense inclusions of amorphous aggregates in the central vacuoles of these cells. In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify 860-bp cDNA fragments containing the CMV coat protein (CP) gene from the embryo, endosperm, and pollen tissues of CMV-infected plants. Taken together, these studies indicate that CMV occurs in virtually all spinach reproductive tissues. Analysis of several RT-PCR amplified and cloned CP genes and flanking sequences from parent and progeny plants revealed that the spinachinfecting CMV was a member of subgroup II. Furthermore, cDNA sequencing and restriction endonuclease mapping consistently revealed two sequence variants, designated SP103 and SP104, in most plants analyzed.

Two models, one for the infection stage and one for the sporulation stage of a pathogen's life cycle, describe reproductive output of pathogen strains in mixture as a function of the strains' population densities. Model parameters include infection and sporulation efficiencies, carrying capacities on leaves for sporulating lesions and spore production, and coefficients of interstrain competitive effects in both life cycle stages. Although the models were originally developed for rust fungi, they are generally applicable to any organism with distinct colonization (e.g., infection) and propagative (e.g., sporulation) life cycle stages. In this work, paired hypothetical strains were assigned equal baseline parameter values. Parameters were then altered one at a time for one or both strains, and relative fitness was calculated over a range of densities and strain frequencies. Except for infection efficiency, the fitness benefit conferred by an advantage in a single parameter was always density dependent. Relative fitness was frequency dependent whenever inter- and intrastrain competitive effects were not equal. These results suggest that the fitness of pathogens in nature is rarely fixed, but, rather, may typically be highly dependent on the densities and frequencies of all coexisting strains in a habitat."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18944998"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0031-949X","MedlineTA":"Phytopathology","NlmUniqueID":"9427222","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1094/PHYTO.1998.88.1.45","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18944998","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The possibility that PSV-BV-15 RNA2 may contain short regions derived from a subgroup II strain (i.e., represent a mosaic structure indicative of recombination) was investigated.

In both interactions, infected roots did not exhibit obvious symptoms; however, major physiological changes occurred within the host tissues colonized by Pythium group F compared to P. uncinulatum. According to our cytological observations, Pythium group F colonization involved a series of events: first, development and growth of the fungus in the epidermis and outer cortex tissues, which was associated with marked host cell disorganization and even breakdown. In colonized roots, symptoms were not easily discernible because alterations were restricted to the epidermis and outer cortex tissues. Second, pathogen ingress in the inner cortex and stele tissues was associated with massive induction of host defense reactions and alteration of invading hyphae. In a complex interaction that involved major metabolic changes in root cells, an array of defense-related reactions was produced, as exemplified by the formation of wall appositions and plugging of host cells with osmiophilic, electron-dense, granular, or fibrillar materials. P. uncinulatum growth was restricted to the epidermis and outer cortex tissues and associated with relatively minor damage to host cells. P. uncinulatum colonization of root tissues did not result in defense events similar to those observed in Pythium group F-infected inner cortex and stele tissues. Moreover, most of the invading P. uncinulatum hyphae were moribund. The results of the current study indicated that symptomless infections can be insignificant in terms of pathology for the plant (i.e., P. uncinulatum) or can be potentially dangerous (i.e., Pythium group F). Our results clearly showed a striking difference between nonpathogenic and minor pathogenic Pythium spp. attacks. The description of the Pythium group F infection process suggests that this interaction is unique, because the fungus behaves as a necrotrophic fungus in the epidermis and outer cortex tissues, whereas it is a potential inducer of plant defense reactions in the inner cortex and stele tissues. To our knowledge, cytological events similar to those observed with Pythium group F have not been described until now, even though descriptions of these events could help elucidate several aspects of the relationships between plants and minor pathogens."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18944970"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0031-949X","MedlineTA":"Phytopathology","NlmUniqueID":"9427222","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1094/PHYTO.1998.88.3.234","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18944970","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Calibration of the sensor was done in the laboratory using water drops of known diameter impacting with known velocity, and thus, with known kinetic energy. The relationship between pulse-count output of the sensor minus the background pulse counts when no drops were impacting (O; per min) and kinetic energy flux density (i.e., power [P; mJ cm(-2) min(-1)]) was found to be described by the formula P; = (0.204 + 0.065 .

In 2 years of field testing, 85 individual rain episodes were monitored, with mean intensities ranging from 0.1 to 42 mm/h. These rains had mean powers ranging from 0 to 5 mJ cm(-2) min(-1), and the highest power for a 5-min sampling period was 10 mJ cm(-2) min(-1).

Ninety-eight percent of the cankers surveyed contained a single DNA haplotype, suggesting spermogonia within cankers are the result of clonal reproduction. A single canker contained two haplotypes that were divided between the upper and lower parts of the canker, suggesting it represented two confluent cankers. In contrast, genotypic diversity was high among cankers. Thirty-seven haplotypes were found among forty-three cankers sampled, and an analysis of molecular variance indicated that 93% (P < 0.001) of the total genetic diversity was attributable to sampling of different cankers, strongly suggesting that multiple infections do not take place in the white pine blister rust pathosystem, i.e., a canker is the result of infection by a single genotype. This result is in contrast with the high level of genetic diversity previously reported among dikaryotic aecidia within cankers and is consistent with the hypothesis that variability in the aecidial stage is the result of outcrossing between resident spermogonia and alien spermatia. The genetic structure of the spermogonial stage, which is the vegetative extension of infection by basidiospores and, therefore, the indirect result of meiosis, was consistent with random mating; the observed genotypic diversity was not significantly different (P > 0.05) from the genotypic diversity expected under the assumption of panmixis.

Cultures were identified as P. longicolla, D. phaseolorum var. caulivora, D. phaseolorum var. meridionalis, or D. phaseolorum var. sojae. Molecular markers for these groups were developed and analyzed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the 5.8S ribosomal DNA. The ITS(4) and ITS(5) primers amplified PCR products for all isolates studied. Gel electrophoresis of undigested PCR products and DNA sequencing produced various fragment lengths including 604 bp for P. longicolla, 602 and 603 bp for D. phaseolorum var. caulivora, 603 bp for D. phaseolorum var. meridionalis, and from 597 to 609 bp for D. phaseolorum var. sojae. Digestion of these PCR products with enzymes AluI, HhaI, MseI, RsaI, and ScrFI resulted in distinct bands for identification of P. longicolla and the varieties of D. phaseolorum I. All P. longicolla, D. phaseolorum var. caulivora, and D. phaseolorum var. meridionalis isolates were distinguished using AluI and HhaI with RsaI or ScrFI. The banding patterns of D. phaseolorum var. sojae isolates were complex and were separated into 11 subgroups after digestion with AluI, HhaI, MseI, RsaI, and ScrFI. Phylogenetic analysis of 20 isolates of D. phaseolorum and P. longicolla based on the DNA sequence of the ITS region resolved six clades termed A, B, C, D, E, and F. Clade A included all sequenced D. phaseolorum var. caulivora isolates, two from Italy and one from the United States. Isolates in clade B were exclusively associated with D. phaseolorum var. meridionalis. Clades A and B formed a well-supported monophyletic group. Isolates in clades C, D, E, and F were morphologically defined as isolates of P. longicolla, D. phaseolorum var. sojae, and Diaporthe spp. The ITS sequences similarity of seven geographically diverse P. longi-colla isolates illustrated that P. longicolla isolates have a similar genetic background, with some affiliations to some D. phaseolorum var. sojae isolates. Morphological characteristics of the isolates along with the terminal clades of the ITS phylogeny suggest that P. longicolla is an individual species, D. phaseolorum var. caulivora and D. phaseolorum var. meridionalis are varieties of D. phaseolorum, and D. phaseolorum var. sojae is either several varieties of D. phaseolorum or possibly several distinct species."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18944833"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0031-949X","MedlineTA":"Phytopathology","NlmUniqueID":"9427222","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1094/PHYTO.1998.88.12.1306","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18944833","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

A concerted approach involving cytological and molecular techniques was initiated to investigate the role of the fungus' xylanolytic system in the interaction. Using enzyme-gold and immuno-gold electron-microscopic techniques, the presence of arabinoxylans in cell walls of rye ovarian tissues (i.e., along the usual path of infection of C. purpurea) was confirmed; tissue-print and immunostaining analyses indicated the presence of xylanase(s) exclusively in ovaries infected with C. purpurea. This strongly suggests that C. purpurea secretes xylanase while colonizing its host. Two xylanase genes (cpxyl1 and cpxyl2) were isolated from a genomic library of C. purpurea using genes from Cochliobolus carbonum (xyl1) and Magnaporthe grisea (xyn33) as heterologous probes. cpxyl1 of C. purpurea had an open reading frame (ORF) of 832 bp interrupted by a 181-bp intron. The derived gene product (CPXYL1) had a molecular mass of 21.5 kDa and an pI of 8.88; it showed significant homology to family G endo-beta-1,4-xylanases. The cpxyl2 ORF (1,144 bp) contained two introns (76 and 90 bp) and coded for a polypeptide of 33.8 kDa with an pI of 7.01; CPXYL2 belonged to family F xylanases. Southern analyses with genomic DNA demonstrated that both genes were single-copy genes. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, it could be shown that both genes were expressed in vitro and in planta (during all infection stages). Inactivation of cpxyl1 was achieved by a gene-replacement approach.

The spatial spread of disease was simulated using a half-Cauchy distribution with median dispersal distance mu (units of distance). The rate of temporal increase in disease incidence (beta(I), per day) was influenced jointly by mu and by the sporulation rate lambda (spores per lesion per day). The relationship between beta(I) and mu was nonlinear: the increase in beta(I) with increasing mu was greatest when mu was small (i.e., when the dispersal gradient was steep). The rate of temporal increase in disease severity of diseased plants (beta(S)) was affected mainly by lambda: beta(S) increased directly with increasing lambda. Intraclass correlation (kappa(t)), the correlation of disease status of plants within quadrats, increased initially with disease incidence, reached a peak, and then declined as disease incidence approached 1.0. This relationship was well described by a power-law model that is consistent with the binary form of the variance power law. The amplitude of the model relating kappa(t) to disease incidence was affected mainly by mu: kappa(t) decreased with increasing mu. The shape of the curve was affected mainly by initial conditions, especially the spatial pattern of the initial inocula. Generally, the relationship of spatial autocorrelation (rho(t,k)), the correlation of disease status of plants at various distances apart, to disease incidence and distance was well described by a four-parameter power-law model. rho(t,k) increased with disease incidence to a maximum and then declined at higher values of disease incidence, in agreement with a power-law relationship. The amplitude of rho(t,k) was determined mainly by initial conditions and by mu: rho(t,k) decreased with increasing mu and was lower for regular patterns of initial inocula. The shape of the rho(t,k) curve was affected mainly by initial conditions, especially the spatial pattern of the initial inocula.

The B biotype of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci efficiently transmitted both native virus and progeny virus derived from cloned DNA inoculum. Host ranges of native virus and of progeny virus derived from cloned DNA were identical based upon whitefly and biolistic mediated transmission, respectively. BCMoV has a relatively wide experimental host range among begomoviruses known to infect bean, encompassing genera and species within the Fabaceae, Malvaceae, and Solanaceae. BCMoV has a bipartite genome, as do other New World begomoviruses. BCMoV DNA-A shared highest nucleotide sequence identities with squash leaf curl virus-E strain (SLCV-E) and cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCV) at 80.1 and 80.7%, respectively. BCMoV DNA-B shared highest nucleotide sequence identity with SLCV-E at 70.7%. The common region (CR) sequences of BCMoV and SLCV-E are 73 to 76% identical; however, modular cis-acting elements within the CR involved in replication origin function and recognition are 100% conserved. Phy-logenetic analysis indicated that BCMoV DNA-A shares a most recent common ancestor with the DNA-A of two viruses that also occur in the Sonoran Desert, SLCV-E and Texas pepper virus (TPV-TAM), and CaLCV from Florida. In contrast, a phylogenetic analysis indicated that BCMoV DNA-B shares a most recent common ancestor with SLCV-E; whereas DNA-B of CaLCV clustered in a separate clade with pepper hausteco virus. Collectively, biological and molecular characteristics indicate that BCMoV is a distinct begomovirus species with the northernmost distribution of any begomovirus isolated from bean in the Americas. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationships of begomovirus cognate components are not necessarily identical, suggesting that DNA-A and DNA-B of some begomoviruses may have different evolutionary histories."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18944770"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0031-949X","MedlineTA":"Phytopathology","NlmUniqueID":"9427222","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1094/PHYTO.1999.89.4.273","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18944770","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Steps in these colonization strategies include modification of the leaf habitat, aggregation, ingression, and egression. Considerable evidence indicates that bacteria can modify their environment to enhance their colonization of plants, such as by increasing local nutrient concentrations or by producing a layer of extracellular polysaccharides. This local habitat modification may occur on the surface of leaves, as well as in the leaf interior, and may be enhanced by the formation of bacterial aggregates. The conspicuous presence of bacterial aggregates on leaves and the finding that the behavior of bacteria on plants varies in a density-dependent manner indicate the potential importance of cooperative interactions among phyllobacteria. Such cooperative interactions may occur among both homogeneous and heterogeneous populations, thus influencing the development of microbial communities. While the sites commonly colonized by most phyllobacteria have not been unambiguously identified, there is strong circumstantial evidence that a sizable proportion of cells, particularly of phytopathogenic strains, are localized within \"protected sites\" on plants. The likelihood that these protected sites are located in the interior of leaves indicates that phytopathogenic bacteria have access to more resources and greater protection from stresses associated with the leaf surface than bacteria that are restricted to the leaf surface. The internal and external leaf-associated populations probably form a continuum due to the processes of ingression and egression. For a specific pathogen, however, the extent of egression that occurs prior to disease induction is likely to influence the success of disease predictions based on external population size, i.e., the number of bacteria in leaf washings. In this review, we illustrate the complexity of the ecology of leaf-associated bacteria and propose a model of leaf colonization that emphasizes the common elements in bacterial colonization strategies, as well as allows for distinct behavior of different phyllobacterial species."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18944746"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0031-949X","MedlineTA":"Phytopathology","NlmUniqueID":"9427222","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1094/PHYTO.1999.89.5.353","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18944746","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

We analyzed 115 isolates of Eutypa and conspecific strains, including 106 from California, using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and sequence analysis of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence. Strains from cultivated plant species exhibited an average genetic distance of 0.34, as calculated by the DICE coefficient (NTSYS-pc software). An unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages dendrogram revealed a genetically distinct (distance of 0.73) group of Eutypa strains from valley oak (Quercus lobata) and madrone (Arbutus menziesii) and a strain from grape. Analysis of rDNA ITS sequences strongly supported the genetically distinct cluster detected in the AFLP data. Combined data indicated the presence of two species of Eutypa (E. armeniacae and E. lata) in our sample population.

Here, a simple approximation for the beta-binomial-based function is derived. This approximation has a functional form based on the binomial distribution, but with the number of individuals per sampling unit (n) replaced by a parameter (v) that has similar interpretation as, but is not the same as, the effective sample size (n(deff) ) often used in survey sampling. The value of v is inversely related to the degree of heterogeneity of disease and generally is intermediate between n(deff) and n in magnitude. The choice of v was determined iteratively by finding a parameter value that allowed the zero term (probability that a sampling unit is disease free) of the binomial distribution to equal the zero term of the beta-binomial. The approximation function was successfully tested on observations of Eutypa dieback of grapes collected over several years and with simulated data.

Plants of the Spanish cv. Spanco and the runner cvs. Florunner and Okrun were exposed to constant temperatures of 18 to 30 degrees C during 12-h periods of wetness each day that totaled 12 to 84 h following inoculation of leaves with conidia. Severity of disease, measured by either lesion density (number per leaf) or lesion size (diameter), was greatest for 'Spanco', intermediate for 'Florunner', and lowest for 'Okrun' in each of two experiments. Lesion density was evaluated further because it was an indicator of both the occurrence and degree of infection. Nonlinear regression analysis was employed to evaluate the combined effects of temperature (T) and wetness duration (W) on lesion density (Y). In the regression model, the Weibull function characterized the monotonic increase of Y with respect to W, while a hyperbolic function characterized the unimodal response of Y with respect to T. Parameters for the intrinsic rate of change with respect to W (b), the intrinsic rate of change with respect to T (f), the optimal value of T (g), and the upper limit (e) when T is optimum (T = g) were estimated for each cultivar and experiment. The effect of cultivar was characterized primarily by differences in the upper limit parameter e. In each experiment, e was greatest for 'Spanco', intermediate for 'Florunner', and least for 'Okrun'. The effect of cultivar on b followed a pattern similar to that for e in experiment 1, but not in experiment 2. Differences among cultivars for estimates of f and g were small and inconsistent. Estimates for g were precise for each cultivar and experiment and fell within the range of 22.3 to 23.2 degrees C. Cultivar responses to T and W were further evaluated using data pooled over the two experiments. Parameter e was estimated for each cultivar, but common values of b, f, and g were estimated. At e = 22.8 degrees C, lesion density approached an upper limit of 96, 17, and 6 lesions per leaf for the cvs. Spanco, Florunner, and Okrun, respectively. These fitted values approximated the observed values of 86, 25, and 9 lesions per leaf for the respective cultivars. Cultivars varied in their response to W at a given T. At 22.8 degrees C, one lesion per leaf was expected following 26, 30, and 36 h of wetness for 'Spanco', 'Florunner', and 'Okrun', respectively.

No automated methods have been successfully applied to classification of bone marrows cells because automated blood cell analysers have been incapable of identifying erythroblasts. The present study was designed to evaluate automated analysis of bone marrow aspirates with the CELL-DYN 4000 (CD4000) haematology analyser, which enables automated determination of erythroblast counts in both the normal mode (haemolytic time; 11.5 s) and the resistant RBC mode (34.0 s). The percentages of subpopulations including lymphocytes, neutrophils and erythroblasts were obtained with the CD4000, and as a reference, differential counts by microscopic observation of May-Grünwald-Giesa-stained films of bone marrow aspirates were performed (n=98). Significant correlations (P < 0.01) between the results obtained with the two methods were observed for total nucleated cell count and lymphocytes, neutrophils, erythroblasts and myeloid/erythroid (M/E) ratio. However, there were biases in the average percentages of erythroblasts, lymphocytes and M/E ratio obtained using the normal mode with the CD4000 toward values lower than those obtained with the microscopic method. Using the RBC resistant mode with the CD4000, the average percentages of erythroblasts, lymphocytes and M/E ratio approximated those obtained with the microscopic method. In conclusion, the CD4000 in resistant RBC mode is more useful for analysis of bone marrow aspirates than is the normal mode, because the former better approximates the M/E ratio than the latter."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"18","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18924861"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1463-9246","MedlineTA":"J Autom Methods Manag Chem","NlmUniqueID":"100885454","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1155/S1463924600000109","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18924861","IdType":"pubmed"},{"value":"PMC2548260","IdType":"pmc"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

IMS are capable of analysing complex mixtures and producing a simple spectral output. Volatile components produce measurable negative and positive product ions in the spectrometer through chemical ionization. The spectra produced are essentially the vapour phase fingerprints of the target molecules/mixture. Quantitative data can be obtained provided instrument response is within the linear dynamic range of these instruments, but most practical applications of IMS have used the technology in a qualitative manner in situations which require just an above/below threshold or positive/ negative response.In the manufacturing industry there are many examples where the aroma/odour of raw materials has safety or product quality implications. IMS was not developed to replace traditional methods of analysis, e.g. GC/MS or sensory panels, but rather to provide a rapid, qualitative response complementary to more established methods. This paper reports on the use of a hand-held ion mobility spectrometer to characterize the vapours produced by volatile organic compounds,fresh herbs and retail spice mixtures at ambient temperature and pressure. The results show that by monitoring in both ion acquisition modes, ion mobility spectrometers are capable of discriminating between a wide range of products."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"07","Year":"2011"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18924815"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0142-0453","MedlineTA":"J Automat Chem","NlmUniqueID":"8209386","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1155/S1463924698000017","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18924815","IdType":"pubmed"},{"value":"PMC2548142","IdType":"pmc"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

As sample preparation protocols become more involved, automation can help to achieve and maintain a desired sample throughput. To address the needs of our screening program, two robotic systems were designed. The first system processes crude extracts all the way to 96-well plates, containing solutions suitable for screening in biological and biochemical assays. The system can dissolve crude extracts, fractionate them on solid-phase extraction cartridges, dry and weigh each fraction, re-dissolve them to a known concentration, and prepare mother plates. The second system replicates mother plates into a number of daughter plates."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"18","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18924691"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1463-9246","MedlineTA":"J Autom Methods Manag Chem","NlmUniqueID":"100885454","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1155/S1463924600000316","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18924691","IdType":"pubmed"},{"value":"PMC2562834","IdType":"pmc"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"18","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"10","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

We review and formalize several patch-use models from which we derive predictions for how the degree of coupling (from the predators' perspective) between nesting guilds (defined as species nesting within a vegetation stratum) affects the outcome of shared predation. We then determine which model best applies to nest predation on woodland songbirds and artificial nests by a natural population of raccoons. Using artificial nests, we showed that increasing the density of nests placed either in shrubs or on the ground increased overall predation (i.e., proportion of nests) on both types. We also tested for apparent competition between American robin and wood thrush, two coexisting woodland songbirds that commonly nest within the shrub stratum. Nest predation increased for wood thrushes but not robins as the combined density of robin and thrush nests within two individual substrate types, Lonicera and Rhamnus, increased. Thus, we documented apparent competition both within and among nesting guilds. We discuss the possible relevance of this interaction in determining species diversity, particularly in the light of increasing generalist nest predators through anthropogenically driven changes in human-altered landscapes."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"28","Month":"01","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18811447"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-0147","MedlineTA":"Am Nat","NlmUniqueID":"2984688R","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1086/286177","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18811447","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Without disturnities bance, local dynamics were driven by a pattern of cyclic succession, where 'colonizer' and 'successor' species alternately replaced each other. This results in a strong pattern of negative correlation in the temporal distribution of colonizer and successor species. As disturbance rates were increased, the relationship shifted from being negatively correlated in time to being positively correlated-the dynamics became decoupled from the ecologically driven cyclic succession and were increasingly influenced by abiotic factors (e.g., rainfall events). Further analysis of the spatial relationships among colonizer and successor species showed that, without disturbance, periods of attraction and repulsion between colonizer and successor species alternate cyclically at intermediate spatial scales. This was due to the spatial 'memory' embedded in the system through the process of cyclic succession. With the addition of disturbance, this pattern breaks down, although there is some indication of increasing ecological organization at broader spatial scales.

However, strategic models dealing with honesty have largely ignored the implications of noise and perceptual error for signal evolution (just as models dealing with signal detection in the presence of noise ignore strategic issues). Here, I analyze an extended version of Maynard Smith's strategic model of signaling of need between relatives, the Philip Sidney game, that incorporates the possibility of perceptual error. I show that even in the presence of noise, there exists over a wide range of parameter values a unique, continuously stable signaling equilibrium, at which the signaler employs a costly display when needy but refrains from doing so when healthy. For a subset of this range, there also exists a second, lower cost signaling equilibrium that is not continuously stable. At the former equilibrium, predicted signal cost is inversely related to the coefficient of relatedness (r) between signaler and receiver. Cost is not, however, predicted to drop to zero even when r = 1 and there is no conflict of interest between the two (as is the case in errofree models), because it serves to enhance the efficacy of communication as well as to discourage deceit. Equilibrium signal cost is inversely related to the probability that the signaler is needy, and tends to increase with the level of noise. If noise becomes too great (i.e., if a detectable signal is too costly to produce), signaling is no longer stable; surprisingly, it is also unstable if the level of noise is too low (i.e., if a detectable signal is too cheap to produce)."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"27","Month":"01","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18811400"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-0147","MedlineTA":"Am Nat","NlmUniqueID":"2984688R","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1086/286148","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18811400","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

This prediction emerges from theory irrespective of the particular genetic mechanisms responsible for variation in aging. Yet this critical relationship has not been confirmed in comparative studies of natural populations. In the present analysis, rate of aging is estimated by the rate of increase in mortality rate (mx) with age (x). Comparisons between natural and captive populations of birds suggest that the Weibull model (mx = m0 + alphaxbeta) provides a better description of aging than the Gompertz model (mx = m0esigmax). Rate of aging is quantified by the parameter omega (dimension: 1/time), which is calculated from the Weibull parameters alpha and beta (omega = alpha1/(beta+1)). In this analysis, rate of aging in birds and mammals is directly related to extrinsic mortality (estimated by the initial mortality rate, m0) independently of taxonomic group and of variation in body size and, by implication, metabolic rate. When time is expressed in years, rate of senescence is related to initial mortality rate by omega = 0.294m0(0.367). This result implies that natural selection in response to variation among taxa in m0 has resulted in the evolutionary modification of factors that influence the rate of aging in natural populations. The potential strength of selection on factors that could further reduce rate of aging is indicated by the proportion of deaths due to aging-related causes. Although species with low initial mortality rates also exhibit reduced rates of increase in mortality rate with age (i.e., delayed senescence), the relatively high proportion of aging-related deaths in such species suggests that further evolutionary responses leading to long life are severely constrained. This argues against mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy as genetic mechanisms underlying senescence and suggests, instead, that rate of aging represents a balance between wear and tear, on the one hand, and genetically controlled mechanisms of prevention and repair, on the other. Evidently, remedies for extreme physiological deterioration in old age either are not within the range of genetic variation or are too costly to be favored by selection."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"27","Month":"01","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18811399"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-0147","MedlineTA":"Am Nat","NlmUniqueID":"2984688R","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1086/286147","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18811399","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Control and hormone-treated (flightless) G. assimilis did not differ in the amount of food consumed or assimilated on any of three diets that differed in nutrient quantity. Thus, enhanced ovarian growth of flightless individuals resulted from increased allocation of internal nutrients to reproduction (i.e., a trade-off) rather than from increased acquisition of nutrients. Compared with flight-capable controls, flightless G. assimilis also had reduced whole-organism respiration, reduced respiration of flight muscles, and reduced lipid and triglyceride (flight fuel) reserves. These differences are remarkably similar to those between naturally occurring flightless and flight-capable morphs of other Gryllus species. Results collectively suggest that the increased allocation of nutrients to ovarian growth in flightless G. assimilis and other Gryllus species results from reduced energetic costs of flight muscle maintenance and/or the biosynthesis or acquisition of lipids. Reduction in these energetic costs appears to be an important driving force in the evolution of flightlessness in insects. Respiratory metabolism associated with flight capability utilizes an increasing proportion of the energy budget of crickets as the quantity of nutrients in the diet is decreased. This leads to a magnification of greater ovarian growth of flightless versus flight-capable individuals on nutrient-poor diets."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"27","Month":"01","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18811398"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-0147","MedlineTA":"Am Nat","NlmUniqueID":"2984688R","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1086/286146","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18811398","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Parasite size and intensity were negatively correlated independently of all other parasite and host factors considered and regardless of type of analyses (i.e., nonphylogenetic or phylogenetically based statistical analyses, and across or within communities). No other nematode life-history traits had independent effects on intensity. Slopes of size-intensity relationships were consistently shallow, around -0.20 on log-log scale, and thus inconsistent with the energetic equivalence rule.

A summary of published values suggests similar convergence toward a global value around -0.75 among free-living animals. Steeper slopes of size-abundance relationships among free-living animals could be related to fundamental differences in ecologies between parasites and free-living animals, although such generalizations require reexamination of size-abundance relationships among free-living animals with regard to confounding factors, in particular by use of phylogenetically based statistical methods.

We develop and analyze a quantitative coevolutionary model for a predator-prey interaction. If the model is modified appropriately, the results could broadly apply to multispecies communities and to herbivore-plant, parasite-host, and parasitoid-host associations. Model populations are distributed over a gradient in prey birth rate (as a measure of productivity). Each population, in each patch, is made up of a suite of strains. Each strain of the predator has a certain ability to successfully attack each strain of the prey. We consider scenarios of isolated patches, global migration, and stepping-stone (i.e., local) migration over a linear string of patches. The most pervasive patterns are the following: investments in predator offense and prey defense are both maximal in the patches of highest prey productivity; when there are no constraints on maximal investment, mean predation evolves to highest levels in the most productive patches; similarly, the predator has a greater impact (measured as the percentage reduction in prey density) on the prey population in high productivity patches as compared with low productivity ones-in spite (even after evolution) of prey abundance being highest in the most productive patches; and migration has the net effect of shunting relatively offensive and defensive strains from productive patches to nonproductive ones, potentially resulting in the elimination of otherwise rare, low-investment clones. A modification of the model to gene-for-gene type interactions predicts that generalist strains (in terms of the range of strains the predator can exploit or the prey can fend off) dominate in productive areas of the prey, whereas specialists prevail in marginal habitats. Assuming a wide range of productivities over the prey's geographical distribution, the greatest strain diversity should be found in habitats of intermediate productivity. We discuss the implications of our study for adaptation and conservation. Empirical studies are in broad accord with our findings."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"28","Month":"01","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18811368"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-0147","MedlineTA":"Am Nat","NlmUniqueID":"2984688R","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1086/286194","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18811368","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Do plant species naturally fall into distinct groups corresponding to masting and nonmasting habits? Do plant populations generally exhibit significant bimodality in annual seed output? Are there significant relationships between annual variability in seed production and pollination and seed dispersal modes, as predicted from economy of scale considerations? We failed to identify distinct groups of species with contrasting levels of annual variability in seed output but did find evidence that most polycarpic woody plants seem to adhere to alternating supra-annual schedules consisting of either high or low reproduction years. Seed production was weakly more variable among wind-pollinated taxa than animal-pollinated ones. Plants dispersed by mutualistic frugivores were less variable than those dispersed by either inanimate means or animals that predominantly behave as seed predators. We conclude that there are no objective reasons to perpetuate the concept of mast fruiting in the ecological literature as a shorthand to designate a distinct biological phenomenon. Associations between supra-annual variability in seed output and pollination and seed dispersal methods suggest the existence of important reproductive correlates that demand further investigation."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"28","Month":"01","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18811365"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-0147","MedlineTA":"Am Nat","NlmUniqueID":"2984688R","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1086/286191","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18811365","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Further assuming that a stable equilibrium with positive population densities exists, we are able to perform a complete frequency analysis of the system. If only one of the populations is subject to noise, the relative noise response by both populations is fully determined by the sign of a single element of the Jacobian matrix. The analysis is readily extended to cases when both species are affected by noise or when the food web has more than two species. The general conclusion about relative responses to noise is then less unambiguous, but the power spectra describing the frequency composition of the population variabilities are nevertheless completely determined. These results are entirely independent on the exact nature of the interaction (i.e., predation, competition, mutualism) between the populations. The results show that the interpretation of the \"color\" of ecological time series (i.e., the frequency composition of population variability over time) may be complicated by species interactions.

This apparent paradox has been used to argue against the importance of competition as a diversifying evolutionary force. We provide an alternative explanation based on optimal foraging theory. Some resources are intrinsically easy to use and are widely preferred, while others require specialized phenotypic traits on the part of the consumer. This asymmetry allows optimally foraging consumers to evolve phenotypic specializations on nonpreferred resources without greatly compromising their ability to use preferred resources. The evolution of phenotypic specialization on nonpreferred resources can be driven by competition, but the specialists act as ecological generalists whenever their preferred resources are available. Our model identifies at least three different concepts of specialization that need to be distinguished, based on diet, prey utilization efficiencies, and phenotypic adaptations. The relationships among these concepts are complex and often counterintuitive. Specialists should often reject the very resources that they have evolved traits to use. The most extreme phenotypic specializations should occur in the absence of a trade-off between using preferred and nonpreferred resources. Our model may explain why extreme phenotypic-specializations evolve more often in fish communities than in terrestrial vertebrate communities and provides a mechanism whereby species can coexist in stable communities despite common preferences for some resources."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"27","Month":"01","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18811353"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-0147","MedlineTA":"Am Nat","NlmUniqueID":"2984688R","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1086/286113","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18811353","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Although a variety of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this behavior, most assume either that brood amalgamation is accidental (i.e., nonselected) or that adoption of young is selected for because of social benefits to the young and/or adopting parents. We propose, instead, that brood amalgamation is a function of two separate processes: brood desertion and brood adoption. To examine brood desertion, we develop a graphic model to predict when parents should abandon their young and we test this model experimentally for the Barrow's goldeneye (Bucephala islandica). As predicted, females deserted their offspring when the size of the brood was experimentally reduced. Brood adoption occurred when deserted ducklings joined other broods. However, the success of ducklings in doing so was strongly dependent on the availability of potential host broods and on the age of the recipient broods. Foreign ducklings were readily accepted into young broods (<10 d old) but invariably were rejected from old broods. We could detect no benefits or costs of brood adoption to the host females, contrary to the expectations of a social benefit hypothesis. Our experiments indicate that Crèching behavior is driven by selection on adults to abandon their brood when the benefits of continued investment are outweighed by the reduction in future reproduction and selection on deserted ducklings to join other broods to obtain parental care. Rather than a form of cooperative brood care, Crèching in goldeneyes is perhaps best considered as a form of reproductive parasitism, entailing parent-offspring conflict over brood desertion and intergenerational conflict over adoption of abandoned young."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"27","Month":"01","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18811315"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-0147","MedlineTA":"Am Nat","NlmUniqueID":"2984688R","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1086/286128","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18811315","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

According to classical results from mathematical food web theory, omnivory destabilizes ecological communities, whereas more recent conceptual syntheses suggest that omnivory should be a strongly stabilizing factor in food webs. Working with an arthropod assemblage at Mount Saint Helens, I experimentally addressed this controversy using a two-way factorial design that crossed a manipulation of the degree of omnivory with another \"disturbance\" manipulation that targeted a specific component of the assemblage. In this statistical design, significant interaction effects (i.e., how the community impacts of the disturbance varied with the degree of omnivory) identified key stabilizing or destabilizing influences of omnivory. Overall, my experimental results indicated that increasing the degree of omnivory stabilized community dynamics, in keeping with recent conceptual syntheses."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"26","Month":"01","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18811300"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-0147","MedlineTA":"Am Nat","NlmUniqueID":"2984688R","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1086/286081","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18811300","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Near-exclusive focus on the secondary effect of these forms of harshness has led ecologists to believe that they reduce the importance of ecological interactions, such as competition, and favor coexistence of even ecologically very similar species. By examining both the costs and the benefits, we show that harshness alone does not lessen the importance of species interactions or limit their role in community structure. Species coexistence requires niche differences, and harshness does not in itself make coexistence more likely. Fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., disturbance, seasonal change, and weather variation) also have been regarded as decreasing species interactions and favoring coexistence, but we argue that coexistence can only be favored when fluctuations create spatial or temporal niche opportunities. We argue that important diversity-promoting roles for harsh and fluctuating conditions depend on deviations from the assumptions of additive effects and linear dependencies most commonly found in ecological models. Such considerations imply strong roles for species interactions in the diversity of a community."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"26","Month":"01","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18811299"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-0147","MedlineTA":"Am Nat","NlmUniqueID":"2984688R","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1086/286080","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18811299","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

This study tests two hypotheses about the effect of fights on subsequent space use patterns: first, that settlers win space by winning fights and, second, that fights encourage the establishment of mutually exclusive home ranges between opponents (i.e., \"fights make neighbors\"). The behavior of juvenile Anolts aeneus lizards was recorded as they established territories in patches of habitat in the field. In support of the fights-make-neighbors hypothesis, opponents whose last aggressive interaction was a fight were six times more likely to have mutually exclusive home ranges at the end of the settlement period than were otherwise equivalent dyads whose last encounter was a chase. Contra the hypothesis that settlers win space by winning fights, most last fights ended in a draw, and there was no discernable relationship between the outcome of last fights and the subsequent space use of the contestants. These and previous analyses of settlement behavior in this species suggest that fights during the settlement period encourage the formation of symmetrical social and spatial relationships between neighboring settlers."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"26","Month":"01","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18811296"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-0147","MedlineTA":"Am Nat","NlmUniqueID":"2984688R","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1086/286071","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18811296","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"25","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis showed that the HCV sequence cloned from coinfected individuals is indistinguishable from that identified in other patients. Cotransfection assay confirmed that the core protein expressed from one of the cloned sequence is capable of suppressing the expression of hepatitis B surface and e antigens (HBsAg and HBeAg, respectively). Deletion mapping revealed that the C-terminal hydrophobic region of the HCV. core is necessary for the suppression. Results from reporter assays demonstrated that HCV core protein interacts with the HBV C promoter and enhancer II elements and down-regulates the transcription of HBV as well as other cellular and heterologous viral genes in both hepatic and non-hepatic cell lines.

In common parlance, lyso-PC stimulates PKC at low concentrations, but, conversely, inhibits it at high concentrations. The activity of purified PKC from rat brains was measured in the vesicles made up of dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine (DPPS), 1, 2-sn-diolein (DOG) and different molar ratios of 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoryl-choline (C16:0 lyso-PC). The effect, i. e. stimulation or inhibition on PKC by C16:0 lyso-PC, depends on DPPS and DOG concentrations as well as its own concentration. When the concentration of DOG is stable, this C16:0 lyso-PC action depends on C16:0 lyso-PCIDPPS molar ratio. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), two fluorescence probes and light scattering were used to analyze the physical characteristics of membrane, including thermotropic phase behavior, the turbidity, the lipid molecular acyl chains packing and the head group spacing. The more adulteration of C16:0 lyso-PC in liposome bilayer membrane, the looser acyl chains pack, and the broader head group spacing. DSC results show that there are two immiscible lipid areas in the membrane: C16:0 lyso-PC-rich area and C16: 0 lyso-PC-poor area. When C16:0 lyso-PC/DPPS molar ratio was 0.234, the two areas had the broadest boundary and the activation of PKC was the highest. When the ratio was over 0.434, the phase transition of DPPS disappeared; micelle tended to substitute the structure of bilayer; the activity of PKC was inhibited completely. DOG can stabilize the bilayer structure of membrane, so the C16:0 lyso-PC/DPPS molar ratios to inhibit PKC in lipid mixture with DOG are higher than that without DOG. The ability of C16:0 lyso-PC to change the physical properties and the structure of membrane plays an important role in its effect on PKC activation."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"16","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18726213"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1006-9305","MedlineTA":"Sci China C Life Sci","NlmUniqueID":"9611809","Country":"China"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1007/BF02882899","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18726213","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"22","PubStatus":"received","Month":"2","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"30","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"8","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"30","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"8","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"30","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"8","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The aim of the present study was to analyze the activity of pGluHA in human serum during development and aging, in an apparently healthy population of 139 men and 148 women. To measure pGluHA we used pGlu-beta-naphthylamide as the substrate. Sex differences and age-related changes were observed in men and women. In addition, the developmental profile was notably different between men and women. In men, activity increased steadily until full sexual maturity, but did not change substantially after puberty. In women, activity increased significantly in advanced ages but there were no significant changes in the rest of the age groups tested. Significant sex differences were observed in subjects 46-65 years old, the activity being higher in men than women.

A reliable diagnosis of AD, especially at the very onset, is complicated. Moreover, it is known that about 20% of patients in hospital for Alzheimer-type dementia have unusual clinical symptoms and sometimes a reliable diagnosis depends on post-mortem analysis of brain tissues. Recently, progress has been achieved in the field of genetic risk assessment in AD, and this article discusses the current widespread use of apolipoprotein E (APO E) genotyping as a tool for investigating epidemiologic risk factors for this devastating disease. APO E genotyping investigations have now moved from research laboratories to clinical laboratories, and therefore bioethical controversies are present, because of laboratory investigations of the patient's genome and the scientific uncertainties still existing. These controversies strongly suggest the need for genetic counseling. Herein we propose a model for multidimensional counseling provided by the Geriatric Assessment Unit (GAU), a multidisciplinary approach to counseling involving genetic, medical, social, psychological and medico-legal support. Multidimensional counseling may help patient and family decisions about health problems with the aim of improving the patient's information and knowledge, and ensuring informed consent in decisions concerning a disease associated with cognitive impairment."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18653150"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0167-4943","MedlineTA":"Arch Gerontol Geriatr","NlmUniqueID":"8214379","Country":"Netherlands"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0167-4943(98)00017-X","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18653150","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"11","PubStatus":"received","Month":"7","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"27","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"2","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"2","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"3","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"11","PubStatus":"received","Month":"7","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"27","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"2","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"2","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"3","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"26","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"26","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"26","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Paradoxical embolism is mostly a presumptive diagnosis, while definite demonstration of a thrombus crossing a PFO is rare. We describe the case of an 84-year-old patient with pulmonary embolism in whom a thrombus in transit through a PFO was found by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Treatment with anticoagulants allowed thrombus resolution without evidence of further embolic events. This finding demonstrates that (impending) paradoxical embolism may be present in the 'oldest old'. Its prompt diagnosis may allow effective treatment even with medical therapy alone. We suggest that paradoxical embolism may be not so rare in the elderly.

We examined 1339 subjects. Investigated diseases were: chronic obstructive lung disease, hypertension, arthrosis, diabetes mellitus, neurological disease, myocardial infarction, angina, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease and congestive heart failure. Cognitive status was assessed by means of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), depression symptomatology was evaluated by Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and disability by means of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). This methodological study showed that 27.9% had a MMSE score <24 and the score decreased with age in both sexes. A total of 9.8% of the subjects had severe depression (GDS score >20). Comorbidity was evaluated from the past medical history and confirmed by a clinical exam by a physician. Only 8.7% of subjects were found without chronic illness. Median number of diseases was two, with 26.6% declaring four diseases or more. Comorbidity increased with age, an overall slight decrease of the number of diseases being observed in the subjects >85 years old. Subjects disabled in ADL were 7%, while disabled in IADL were 46.7%.

All patients were over 65 years of age (37 men and 8 women) and had coronary heart disease, documented by an angiographic study and electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia during exercise stress testing, performed according to the Bruce protocol. The subjects were divided in three subgroups: group 1 (22 patients) with electrocardiographic and echocardiographic history of myocardial infarction but no angina chest pain during exercise testing; group 2 (13 patients) with no exercise induced chest pain; and group 3 (10 patients) with exercise-induced chest pain. Baroceptor sensitivity was assessed in all subjects, by evaluating heart rate changes expressed in RR interval on the basis of changes in the mean arterial pressure during intravenous infusion of stepwise doses (50-100 and 150 microg) of phenylephrine hydrochloride. Heart rate changes were also evaluated during overshoot of the Valsalva maneuver (Valsalva max.), providing an index of parasympathetic activity. Our results showed that group two patients (only silent ischemia) had significantly (P>0.001) greater baroceptor sensitivity than the other two groups (group 2; 15.2+/-1.9 ms/mmHg; group 1: 10.0+/-1.7 ms/mmHg; and group 3: 9.8+/-1.7 ms/mmHg). Group two also showed a significant positive correlation (r=0.58; P<0.05) between baroceptor sensitivity and end-diastolic pressure and a significant inverse correlation (r=-0.672; P<0.05) between baroceptor sensitivity and the ejection fraction. Group 2 patients had a significantly longer RR interval than group 1 (P<0.05) and group 3 (P<0.05); a significant positive correlation (r=0.620; P<0.05) between Valsalva max. and end-diastolic pressure; and a significant inverse correlation (r=0.694; P<0.05) between Valsalva max. and the ejection fraction. Valsalva max. and baroceptor sensitivity correlated significantly in all three groups (group 1, r=0.707; P<0.001; group 2, r=0.94; P<0.001; and group 3; r=0.833; P<0.05).

Basal heart rate was similar in all subjects and failed to correlate with age. Skin conductance level decreased with increasing age and correlated negatively and significantly with age. In response to standing and to hyperventilation, heart rate and skin conductance level increased in all groups but the values attained became lower in older subjects. Basal free and total norepinephrine (NE) and total epinephrine (E) correlated positively and significantly with age. In response to standing, free NE determined at the peak heart rate response, increased significantly only in young subjects. In response to hyperventilation free and total NE increased in all subjects.

A sensitive, on-line method was developed for measuring trace levels of dissolved hydrogen in a semi-permeable membrane, situated within the biomass of a 1 L laboratory anaerobic digester, using trace reduction gas analysis. At normal operating conditions, the dissolved hydrogen partial pressure (2 to 8 Pa) was found to be linearly correlated with the loading rate of the digester, and was a sensitive indicator of the effect of shockloads as well as gradual overloading. An increase in hydrogen partial pressure above a critical concentration of 6.5-7 Pa indicated the initial stage of digester overloading (i.e., volatile fatty acids accumulation). A H(2)-based computer control system, using a critical hydrogen partial pressure of 6.5 Pa as the setpoint, was found to be effective for the safe operation of a laboratory digester close to its maximum sustainable loading rate. The existence of a relationship between hydrogen level and organic loading rate was also confirmed on a 600 m(3) industrial digester, with digester overloading occurring at hydrogen concentrations above 7 Pa. The results suggest that the dissolved hydrogen concentration is capable of being a sensitive on-line parameter for the automated management of anaerobic digesters near their maximum sustainable loading capacity.

This research investigates energetic and metabolic changes brought about by the genetic modification of the glucose uptake and phosphorylation system of Escherichia coli. The engineered strain PPA316, which lacks the E. coli phosphotransferase system (PTS) and uses instead the galactose-proton symport system for glucose uptake, exhibited significantly altered metabolic patterns relative to the parent strain PPA305 which retains PTS activity. Replacement of a PTS uptake system by the galactose-proton symport system is expected to lower the carbon flux to pyruvate in both aerobic and anaerobic cultivations. The extra energy cost in substrate uptake for the non-PTS strain PPA 316 had a greater effect on anaerobic specific growth rate, which was reduced by a factor of five relative to PPA 305, while PPA 316 reached a specific growth rate of 60% of that of the PTS strain under aerobic conditions. The maximal cell densities obtained with PPA 316 were approximately 8% higher than those of the PTS strain under aerobic conditions and 14% lower under anaerobic conditions. In vivo NMR results showed that the non-PTS strain possesses a dramatically different intracellular environment, as evidenced by lower levels of total sugar phosphate, NAD(H), nucleoside triphosphates and phosphoenolpyruvate, and higher levels of nucleoside diphosphates. The sugar phosphate compositions, as measured by extract NMR, were considerably different between these two strains. Data suggest that limitations in the rates of steps catalyzed by glucokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase may be responsible for the low overall rate of glucose metabolism in PPA316.

A gene encoding thermostable D-hydantoinase of Bacillus stearothermophilus SD-1 has previously been cloned and constitutively expressed by its native promoter in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Lee et al., 1996b). In this work, we attempted mass production of the D-hydantoinase by batch culture of the recombinant E. coli using glycerol as a carbon source. The plasmid content in cells increased in proportion to the culture temperature, which resulted in a two- or three-fold increase of the specific D-hydantoinase activity at 37 degrees C compared with that at 30 degrees C. The plasmid was stably maintained over 80 generations. When glycerol was initially added to a concentration of 100 g/L, the final biomass concentration reached about 50 g-dry cell weight/L in a 50 L-scale fermentation, resulting in the specific enzyme production of 3.8 x 10(4) unit/g-dry cell weight in a soluble form. Glycerol-using batch cultivation of recombinant E. coli was found to be a cost-effective process for the mass production of industrially useful D-hydantoinase. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

We present a simple model that incorporates the kinetics of substrate dissolution and a simultaneous enzymatic reaction. The model was tested in the alpha-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of an aqueous suspension of dimethyl benzylmethylmalonate to a homogeneous solution of enantiomerically pure monoester. This reaction occurs in the bulk phase, so catalysis by enzyme absorbed at the solid-liquid interface plays no role. The value of the parameters in the model (i.e., the mass transfer coefficient of substrate dissolution (k(L)), the substrate solubility, and the rate constant for the enzymatic reaction) were determined in separate experiments. Using these parameter values, the model gave a good quantitative prediction of the rate of the overall dissolution-reaction process. When the particle size distribution is known, k(L) may also be calculated instead. The model seems to be applicable also for other poorly soluble substrates, other enzymes, and other solvents.

It was found that coinfection with a baculovirus expressing bcl-2 [Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV)-bcl2] extended the life span of High Fivetrade mark cells but not Sf-9 cells when compared to infection with recombinant baculoviruses expressing either human tissue plasminogen activator (AcNPV-tPA) or Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (AcNPV-betagal). Similar results were obtained in coinfection experiments; i.e., AcNPV-bcl2 coinfection increased the life span of High Fivetrade mark cells over that of cells infected with either AcNPV-tPA or AcNPV-betagal alone, but they did not affect the life span of coinfected Sf-9 cells. Coinfection of Sf-9 cells with AcNPV-bcl2 and AcNPV-betagal resulted in a decrease in the maximum beta-gal expression levels of over 90% when compared to infection with AcNPV-betagal alone. A similar trend was found in the beta-gal mRNA levels. Coinfection also resulted in a reduced beta-gal expression level in High Fivetrade mark cells, but the reduction was consistent with what would be expected when two recombinant viruses compete for use of the cellular machinery. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of AcNPV-bcl2 coinfection on betagal expression, t-PA expression levels were either not affected (Sf-9 cells) or were increased 50% (High Fivetrade mark cells) over those obtained by infection with AcNPV-tPA alone. These results support the hypotheses that bcl-2 can inhibit transcription of genes under polyhedrin promoter control and that beta-gal expression levels, but not t-PA expression levels, are controlled at the transcriptional level.

First, the cell size varies with growth conditions, thus yields expressed in terms of cell numbers cannot be used in the normal mass balance sense. Second, experience from microbial systems shows that cell number dynamics lag behind biomass dynamics. This work demonstrates that this lag phenomenon also occurs in animal cell culture. Both the lag phenomenon and the variation in cell size are explained using a simple model of the cell cycle. The basis for the model is that onset of DNA synthesis requires accumulation of G1 cyclins to a prescribed level. This requirement is translated into a requirement for a cell to reach a critical size before commencement of DNA synthesis. A slower growing cell will spend more time in G1 before reaching the critical mass. In contrast, the period between onset of DNA synthesis and mitosis, tau(B), is fixed. The two parameters in the model, the critical size and tau(B), were determined from eight steady-state measurements of mean cell size in a continuous hybridoma culture. Using these parameters, it was possible to predict with reasonable accuracy the transient behavior in a separate shift-up culture, i.e., a culture where cells were transferred from a lean environment to a rich environment. The implications for analyzing experimental data for animal cell culture are discussed. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

This study observed an adverse effect of Primatone RL, an animal tissue hydrolysate commonly used as a serum-substitute to promote cell growth, on sialylation of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) derived from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture in both batch and fed-batch modes. In batch cultures, decreased sialylation was observed at each of the glycosylation sites (i.e., Asn(25) and Asn(97)) of IFN-gamma with the use of elevated concentrations of the peptone. Although poorest sialylation was obtained with the use of a growth-inhibiting concentration of Primatone RL, diminished sialylation was observed at the optimal peptone concentration for cell growth and product yield. Since incubation of the product in Primatone RL-supplemented acellular medium did not result in decreased sialylation, the negative effect of Primatone RL could not be attributed to extracellular desialylation of IFN-gamma by components of the peptone. In the fed-batch mode, a culture utilizing a serum-free feeding medium supplemented with Primatone RL demonstrated poorer sialylation than a similar culture not fed the peptone. The results of both the batch and fed-batch experiments indicate that the adverse effect of the peptone was not due solely to ammonia accumulation. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

There are, however, disadvantages with this cell-based system when carried out in suspension cultures at high bioreactor volume (e.g., limited oxygen transfer, susceptibility to contamination, high cost). These problems can be avoided by using whole larvae as the \"reactors.\" There are, however, other problems encountered with larvae, one being their inaccessibility for product sampling. To combat this problem, we have investigated the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter molecule in Trichoplusia ni insect larvae. A high production level of GFPuv (1.58 mg per larva, 26% of total protein) was obtained, enabling the rapid and non-invasive monitoring of GFP. Bright green light was emitted directly from the large opaque carcasses ( approximately 30mm) after illumination with UV light. Based on the green light intensity and a correlation between intensity and GFP mass, we determined the optimal harvest time (c.a. approximately 3 days post-infection). In parallel experiments, we expressed human interleukin-2 (IL-2) from another recombinant baculovirus with an almost identical expression profile. Since both GFP and IL-2 were rapidly degraded by protease activity during the fourth day post-infection (another disadvantage with larvae), we found an accurate determination of harvest time was critical. Correspondingly, our results demonstrated that GFP was an effective on-line marker for expression of heterologous protein in insect larvae."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"16","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18636639"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0006-3592","MedlineTA":"Biotechnol Bioeng","NlmUniqueID":"7502021","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19971105)56:3<239::AID-BIT1>3.0.CO;2-K","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18636639","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"19","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"19","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"19","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

For this purpose, Corynebacterium glutamicum was grown with [1-(13)C]glucose to metabolic and isotopic steady state and the fractional enrichments in precursor metabolites (e.g., pentose 5-phosphate) were quantified. Matrix calculus was used to express these data together with metabolite mass data. The detailed analysis of the dependence of (13)C enrichments on exchange fluxes enabled the transketolase-catalyzed exchange rate (2 pentose 5-phosphate <--> sedoheptulose 7-phosphate + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) to be quantified as 74.3% (molar metabolite flux) at a net flux of 10.3% and the exchange rate (pentose 5-phosphate + erythrose 4-phosphate <--> fructose 6-phosphate + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) to be quantified as 5.6% at a net flux of 8.1%. The flux entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle was 93.3%. The same comprehensive flux analysis as performed for the nonexcreting condition was done with the identical strain that had been forced to excrete L-glutamate. Because we had already quantified the fluxes for L-lysine excretion with an isogenic strain, three directly comparable flux situations are thus available. Consequently, this comparison permits a direct cause-and-effect relationship to be specified. In response to the different flux burdens of the cell, the PPP flux decreased from a maximum of 67% to 26%, with the glycolytic flux increasing accordingly. The carbon flux through isocitrate dehydrogenase increased from 20% to 36%. The bidirectional carbon flux between pyruvate and oxaloacetate decreased from 36% to 9%. Since the cause of the three different flux states was the allelic exchange in the final L-lysine assembling pathway or the glutamate export activity, respectively, the flexible response is the effect. This shows conclusively the enormous flexibility within the central metabolism of C. glutamicum to supply precursors upon their withdrawal for the synthesis of amino acids.

A small DNA bending protein, Fis, which has been shown to activate rRNA synthesis upon a nutrient upshift, was overexpressed in E. coli strain W3110 carrying vector pUCR1. Overexpression of Fis during exponential growth was shown to activate rrn promoters to different extents. A 5-fold improvement in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) production in cultures with elevated Fis level was observed in shake-flask cultivations. A similar improvement in the culture performance was also observed during fed-batch fermentation; the specific CAT activity increased by more than 50% during the fed-batch phase for cultures with elevated Fis expression. In contrast, no increase in specific CAT activity was detected for cultures carrying pUCR2, expressing a frame-shift Fis mutant. Expression of Fis from a complementary vector, pKFIS, restored CAT production from W3110:pUCR2 to approximately the same level as cultures carrying pUCR1, indicating that the enhancement in CAT production was indeed Fis-dependent. The framework presented here suggests that differential activation in recombinant protein production may be achieved with differential Fis overexpression. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Three main problems arise for the continuous production of MnP during secondary metabolism of Phanerochaete chrysosporium: enzyme production occurs only under specific physiological conditions corresponding to C or N limitation, high O(2) tension, and adequate Mn(+2) concentration; the enzyme that is produced is destabilized by extracellular proteases; and excessive growth of the mycelium blocks effective oxygen transfer. To overcome these drawbacks, continuous production of MnP was optimized by selecting a suitable bioreactor configuration and the environmental and operating conditions affecting both enzyme production and stability. The combination between a proper feed rate and the application of a pulsation in a packed-bed bioreactor permitted the maintenance of continuous secretion of MnP while limiting mycelial growth and avoiding bed clogging. Environmental factors as an Mn(+2) concentration of 5000 microM and high oxygen tension enhanced MnP production. The hydraulics of the bioreactor corresponding to a plug flow model with partial mixing and an operating hydraulic rentention time of 24 h were optimal to achieve stable operating conditions. This policy allowed long operation periods, obtaining higher productivities than the best reported in the literature. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Not only are the experiments much easier to conduct than experiments employing radioactive tracer elements, but NMR spectroscopy also provides additional information on the labeling pattern of the metabolites. Whereas the maximum amount of information obtainable with (14)C-labeled substrates is the fractional enrichment in the individual carbon atom positions, NMR spectroscopy can also provide information on the degree of labeling at neighboring carbon atom positions by analyzing multiplet patterns in NMR spectra or using 2-dimensional NMR spectra. It is possible to quantify the mole fractions of molecules that show a specific labeling pattern, i.e., information of the isotopomer distribution in metabolite pools can be obtained. The isotopomer distribution is the maximum amount of information that in theory can be obtained from (13)C-tracer studies. The wealth of information contained in NMR spectra frequently leads to overdetermined algebraic systems. Consequently, fluxes must be estimated by nonlinear least squares analysis, in which experimental labeling data is compared with simulated steady state isotopomer distributions. Hence, mathematical models are required to compute the steady state isotopomer distribution as a function of a given set of steady state fluxes. Because 2(n) possible labeling patterns exist in a molecule of n carbon atoms, and each pattern corresponds to a separate state in the isotopomer model, these models are inherently complex. Model complexity, so far, has restricted usage of isotopomer information to relatively small metabolic networks. A general methodology for the formulation of isotopomer models is described. The model complexity of isotopomer models is reduced to that of classical metabolic models by expressing the 2(n) isotopomer mass balances of a metabolite pool in a single matrix equation. Using this approach an isotopomer model has been implemented that describes label distribution in primary carbon metabolism, i.e., in a metabolic network including the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas and pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and selected anaplerotic reaction sequences. The model calculates the steady state label distribution in all metabolite pools as a function of the steady state fluxes and is applied to demonstrate the effect of selected anaplerotic fluxes on the labeling pattern of the pathway intermediates."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"16","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18636594"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0006-3592","MedlineTA":"Biotechnol Bioeng","NlmUniqueID":"7502021","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19970920)55:6<831::AID-BIT2>3.0.CO;2-H","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18636594","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"19","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"19","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"19","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

First, the length of the path into the culture traveled by any direct or disperse ray of light was calculated as the function of three variables: day of year, solar hour, and geographic latitude. Then, the phenomenon of light attenuation by biomass was studied considering Lambert-Beer's law (only considering absorption) and the monodimensional model of Cornet et al. (1900) (considering absorption and scattering phenomena). Due to the existence of differential wavelength absorption, none of the literature models are useful for explaining light attenuation by the biomass. Therefore, an empirical hyperbolic expression is proposed. The equations to calculate light path length were substituted in the proposed hyperbolic expression, reproducing light intensity data obtained in the center of the loop tubes. The proposed model was also likely to estimate the irradiance accurately at any point inside the culture. Calculation of the local intensity was thus extended to the full culture volume in order to obtain the average irradiance, showing how the higher biomass productivities in a Phaeodactylum tricornutum UTEX 640 outdoor chemostat culture could be maintained by delaying light limitation.

Both gland types store their specific products within the syncytial cytoplasm of the secretory unit. These secretory materials consist of spheroidal or ellipsoidal bodies (granules) with a repeating substructure. The subcellular features of the immature products of the ordinary serous and inguinal glands are identical. However, these products undergo divergent maturative processes, leading to fluidation on the one hand and condensation on the other. Secretory release into the small gland lumen was observed in both cases, involving merocrine mechanisms. On the basis of the analysis of cutaneous serous gland polymorphism in anurans, the inguinal units in P. biligonigerus do not appear to be an independent line. Rather, these large units belong to the ordinary serous type and represent a gland population specialized in the storage of remarkable amounts of product used in chemical defence of the skin."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"15","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18627874"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0040-8166","MedlineTA":"Tissue Cell","NlmUniqueID":"0214745","Country":"Scotland"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0040-8166(99)90071-X","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"10.1054/tice.1999.0071","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18627874","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"8","PubStatus":"received","Month":"7","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"10","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"8","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"17","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"17","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"17","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Although their development follows the general pattern of teleost tooth formation, first-generation teeth show peculiarities compared with later tooth generations, including their size, bare emergence from the epithelium, absence of dentinal tubules and of nerves and capillaries in the pulp cavity, and organization of the outer dental epithelium. Four developmental stages (a to d) prior to attachment (stage e) have been distinguished. The oral epithelium invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme (stage a) and is later folded to form a bell-shaped dental organ (stage b) without any primordial thickening, or any other morphological indication of imminent invagination. Then, the collagenous enameloid matrix is laid down, most probably by the odontoblasts (early stage c), soon followed by predentine deposition and the beginning of enameloid mineralization (late stage c). With ongoing dentinogenesis, the enameloid matrix matures (stage d), i.e. the organic constituents are removed and the matrix further mineralizes. Finally (stage e), an annular collar of attachment bone is deposited to fix the tooth onto the underlying bone."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"16","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18627834"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0040-8166","MedlineTA":"Tissue Cell","NlmUniqueID":"0214745","Country":"Scotland"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0040-8166(97)80044-4","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18627834","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"17","PubStatus":"received","Month":"3","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"29","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"7","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"17","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"17","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"17","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Therefore, this article will only focus on the contribution of the animal models of infection in: (i) the evaluation of the in vivo activity of antimicrobial agents, using a pharmacodynamic approach. For this purpose, animal models are used to quantify the in vivo bacterial killing and to investigate the different factors influencing the final in vivo activity. (ii) The investigation of the non response to antimicrobial agents in vivo. In this case, animal models are used to investigate the factors limiting the in vivo activity of antimicrobial agents."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"25","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18611822"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0924-8579","MedlineTA":"Int J Antimicrob Agents","NlmUniqueID":"9111860","Country":"Netherlands"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S0924-8579(97)00035-6","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18611822","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"13","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"6","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"10","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"10","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"10","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The effect of temperature was examined in the range of 25 to 45 degrees C for growth and methane utilization. The temperature variations (25-35 degrees C) had minimal effect on growth of M. albus and M. parvus.

The growth and methane consumption was slower for M. trichosporium OB3b as a maximum methane consumption of 0.07 mol%/h was obtained at 25 degrees C and growth was inhibited at 35 degrees C. M. capsulatus grew the best at 37 degrees C and growth was affected at higher temperature of 45 degrees C. Of the different cultures examined, M. albus and M. capsulatus grew the best and were further evaluated for the effect of pressure in the range of 10-50 psi. The results obtained using M. albus demonstrated an enhancement in methane consumption rate by fourfold and final cell concentration by 40% at a pressure of 20 psi by injecting a methane/oxygen mixture, however further increase in the pressure up to 50 psi inhibited the growth. The inhibition was not seen with nitrogen incorporated mixture of oxygen and methane, which suggest that the high partial pressure of methane and/or oxygen are inhibitory for the growth of M. albus.

Biological treatment includes the use of native microorganisms for transformation of the various hydrocarbons found in E&P soils. Degradation of TPH of 80 and 86%, was achieved for two different soils, respectively in control experiments. The effect of growth stimulants such as glucose, acetic acid, and valeric acid was examined on TPH degradation. Incorporation of inducer (valerate) enhanced the degradation up to 89 and 93%, for the two soils, respectively. A large portion (> 41%) of contaminant in one soil was comprised of compounds in the carbon range of C10-C16 and < 7% constituted carbon range of C24-C28. The degradation of C10-C16 compounds was higher (> 98%) as compared to C24-C28 compounds (< 75%). Likewise, the degradation rate was also higher (58 mg/kg/d) for lower compounds as compared to higher carbon range compounds (6.7 mg/kg/d). Experiments conducted on chemical treatment included the effect of chelators on stabilization of H2O2, comparative studies between buffer and water (used for soil preparation), and the effect of pH on TPH degradation. The rate of oxygen evolution from H2O2 was significantly reduced with use of either chelated iron or phosphate buffer using naphthelene as a model compound. Chemical treatment demonstrated a higher degradation of TPH from contaminated soils at pH 4.0 as compared to a pH of 7.0. More degradation was obtained with slurry prepared in phosphate buffer as compared to deionized water."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18576035"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0273-2289","MedlineTA":"Appl Biochem Biotechnol","NlmUniqueID":"8208561","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1007/BF02920182","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18576035","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"26","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"6","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"26","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"6","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"26","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"6","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Deep fibromatoses are large, often rapidly growing but benign soft tissue tumours. Although surgery is the mainstay of treatment, in unremitting and aggressive cases the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy may produce objective tumour responses. Fresh tumour samples from four patients with fibromatosis were investigated as part of a study of drug resistance in soft tissue tumours.Methods. Following short-term culture of fibromatosis cells in vitro , chemosensitivity to 4-hydroperoxy-ifosfamide, the active form of ifosfamide and doxorubicin was tested. Following 72-h continuous exposure to each drug, surviving cell fraction was assessed using the lactate dehydrogenase assay.Results. Mean IC(50) values for ifosfamide and doxorubicin were 6.2 and 0.35 micromol/l, respectively. In samples of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) from the same study the mean IC(50) values for ifosfamide and doxorubicin were 14.8 and 1.69 micromol. The difference in mean ifosfamide IC(50) values for fibromatosis and STS samples was statistically significant.Discussion.

Recently we showed that the 68-kDa fusion protein derived from the EWS/FLI1 hybrid gene can be specifically detected by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody to the C-terminal of FLI1 on biopsy material from Ewing's sarcoma. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this antibody also could be used for immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry in diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma.Methods. Immunostaining on paraffin-embedded archival material, fine-needle aspirates and tumour touch imprints from Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET) for detection of the fusion protein was performed. Most cases were also analysed by Western blotting.Tumours of differential diagnostic importance were also included.Results. Eighty per cent (12/15 cases) of the Ewing tumours exhibited a positive immunoreactivity for the FLI1 antibody. The signal was mainly localised in the nuclei of the tumour cells, which seems reasonable since EWS/FLI1 is a transcription factor. The signal was found to be specific since it did not appear when the blocking peptide was added to the antibody solution.Moreover, two other types of small-round cell tumours (i.e. neuroblastoma and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma) were negative as well as most normal tissues.Discussion. Immunostaining of histological and cytological specimens with the FLI1 antibody can be of diagnostic relevance in Ewing tumours carrying t(11;22).The absence of immunoreactivity in non-Ewing cells is most likely due to a low expression of the wild-type FLI1 protein."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"07","Year":"2011"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18521261"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1357-714X","MedlineTA":"Sarcoma","NlmUniqueID":"9709257","Country":"Egypt"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1080/13577149977839","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18521261","IdType":"pubmed"},{"value":"PMC2395406","IdType":"pmc"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"4","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"6","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"4","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"6","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"4","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"6","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Although surgical, chemo- and radiotherapeutic treatment regimens in patients with soft tissue sarcomas have constantly been refined over the past two decades, the survival rate for these patients is rather low.Discussion. There is a great need to investigate the mechanisms for oncogenesis and to identify the factors involved in malignant transformation in sarcomas. Among these factors, IGFs are thought to play a pivotal role as progression factors in various types of sarcomas. The dysregulation of the IGF-II synthesis, e.g. by loss of imprinting which occurs in most types of sarcomas, is a permissive effect through the suppression of cell death. In addition, cells that overexpress the type I IGF receptors are more susceptible to transformation by oncogenes. As TP53 suppresses the activity of IGF-II P3 and P4, as well as the type I IGF receptor promoter, mutations of TP53 in sarcomas may alternatively lead to the activation of these factors. Finally, the phenomenon of non-islet cell tumour hypoglycaemia that occurs in patients with sarcomas, and which is related to the secretion of IGF-II prohormones, is discussed. Future therapeutic strategies may be based upon the application of antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides directed against the type I IGF receptors, with the common goal of inducing apoptosis in sarcoma cells. Ultimately, these and other therapeutic approaches may lead to a better outcome in patients suffering from sarcoma."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"07","Year":"2011"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18521237"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1357-714X","MedlineTA":"Sarcoma","NlmUniqueID":"9709257","Country":"Egypt"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1080/13577149878028","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18521237","IdType":"pubmed"},{"value":"PMC2395388","IdType":"pmc"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"4","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"6","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"4","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"6","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"4","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"6","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

We prepared 12 prototype moisturizing creams that had identical overall formulae but differed in as far as they contained three different polymers (Carbopol 981, Carbopol 5984 and Permulen TR.-2) each at four concentration levels. Using these creams, we carried out two series of experiments. In the first series, we applied pre-determined quantities of creams to defined areas of skin on the forearms of eight panelists and then measured the subsequent changes in Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) and Skin Capacitance (SC) values as a function of time. In the second series, the panelists were asked to spread and rub over their entire two hands as much of the creams as they deemed necessary for achieving satisfactory perceived moisturization. In this latter series, we also weighed the amounts of cream used and measured the TEWL and SC values at several skin sites as a function of time subsequent to the cream application. The panelists also scored 14 skin attributes for each of the 12 creams used. The same procedures were also carried out with a commercial skin moisturizing cream (Keri(R)) that was used as a control. In separate laboratory experiments, the rheological properties (i.e. the elastic and viscous moduli) of the various creams at a number of frequencies were measured. The analysis of the experimental results suggested that the overall rheology of creams had little direct effect on both, the moisturizing efficacy and the perceived perceptual attributes. Neither did the overall viscoelasticity or the esthetic attributes of the preparations seem to affect the amounts of creams/lotions that the panelists judged to be necessary for achieving satisfactory perceived hand moisturization. Although all preparations contained the same occlusive material (oil) at identical concentration, nevertheless some of the preparations appeared to show different efficacies depending on the nature and the levels of the polymeric ingredient present."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18505539"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0142-5463","MedlineTA":"Int J Cosmet Sci","NlmUniqueID":"8007161","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"ICS203162","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"10.1046/j.1467-2494.1999.203162.x","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18505539","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of different processing conditions (mixing equipment, speed and time of agitation) on the aesthetic characteristics, viscosity and physical stability of o/w emulsion gels based on the polymeric emulsifier (Pemulen TR-2 NF). This objective was achieved by applying a two-factor three-level experimental design at two sets: using a laboratory mixer and a disperser. Independent variables were mixing speed and time and dependant variables i.e. responses, were millimetres of oil phase separated after centrifugation at 3500 rpm in a laboratory centrifuge, and viscosity at shear rate 180 l/s. The responses were fitted into a second order model by means of a multiple regression analysis. For the samples prepared on the laboratory mixer it was shown that mixing time and speed produce a statistically important influence on viscosity, but not on physical stability: with increasing mixing speed and time the viscosity linearly increases. If we assume that greater energy input obtained by increasing the mixing speed and time produces a decrease in drop size and polydispersity and better developed gel network, then the optimal processing conditions will be at the point where maximal viscosity is attained. This result was in accordance with the centrifugation test - the best stability appeared when maximal mixing speed and time were applied, although this effect appeared not to be statistically significant. For samples prepared using dispersers no statistically important influence of processing variables on viscosity and physical stability was found. Additionally, emulsion samples prepared using the laboratory mixer appeared homogenous, while in samples prepared using the disperser, undispersed polymer lumps appeared. Based on physical characteristics of the emulsions, it could be concluded that the disperser is an inappropriate tool for processing the emulsions based on Pemulen polymers."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18505536"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0142-5463","MedlineTA":"Int J Cosmet Sci","NlmUniqueID":"8007161","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"ICS183572","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"10.1046/j.1467-2494.1999.183572.x","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18505536","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Three vitamins (panthenol, cholecalciferol and tocopherol) were used for this study. Vitamins were prepared by dissolving in tetrahydrofuran (ThF), and silylated with bis-trimethylsilyltri-fluoroacetamide- trichloromethylsilane (BSTFA). Silylated vitamins were separated on a fused-silica capillary column coated with DB-5. The identification of each vitamin was accomplished by retention time and mass spectrum library search with a computer, and the quantitation was made in the selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode of GC-MS. SIM mode had given sensitivity to determine 50 pg of panthenol, 285 pg of cholecalciferol and 130 pg of tocopherol. Linearity was maintained over the range 0.005-0.20% for each vitamin. Each cosmetic product (i.e. hair tonic and lotion) was found to contain amounts of the vitamins. This method was sensitive and gave 77.5-99.9% recovery of each vitamin from these cosmetic products.

Moreover, there are not many experimental methods to evaluate the hydrating power of hair care products in the literature. This study proposes a new method to measure the hydration state of treated or untreated hair by using a tensile strength test. A graphic analysis of tensile strength variation as a function of relative humidity after hair treatment allows the calculation of three hydration indexes: protection index, instant hydration index and permanent hydration index. This technique can give useful information on the behaviour of hair versus relative humidity and on the different hydrating mechanisms exhibited by hair care products."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18505508"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0142-5463","MedlineTA":"Int J Cosmet Sci","NlmUniqueID":"8007161","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"ICS176610","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"10.1046/j.1467-2494.1998.176610.x","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18505508","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

A two phase experimental strategy was thought out: the optimal quantities of consistency factors were selected using a Doehlert experimental matrix, whereas the correct mixtures of emollients were determined using a Scheffé simplex-centroid design. These two design were combined and a set of 49 experiments was obtained. The experiments carried out allowed the definition of a zone of two phases in which the objectives were attained: the correct types and appropriate quantities of emollients and waxes were determined. To find a possible correlation between some mixtures and the lipsticks' sensorial behaviour, differential scanning calorimetry was used.

Procyanidins (1-10 muM) strongly and dose-dependently inhibit the formation of PUFA hydroperoxides (IC50 = 4-6 muM), with a potency comparable to that of vitamin E. In these micellar systems, a strong co-operative interaction (synergistic effect) between procyanidins and vitamin E (1:1 molar ratio) in PUFA protection was demonstrated; this, as shown by electron spin resonance (ESR) studies, is a result of the ability of procyanidins to regenerate alpha-tocopherol from the alpha-tocopheroxyl radical (generated by a UV Solar Simulator), through a hydrogen transfer mechanism. HPLC monitoring of vitamin E in PUFAs micelles oxidatively stressed by UVB, confirms that procyanidins save vitamin E from consumption.

Saponins, such as escin, also reduce capillary fragility, and therefore help to prevent leakage of fluids into surrounding tissues, which can cause swelling. An extract of horse chestnut has recently been shown to have one of the highest 'active-oxygen' scavenging abilities of 65 different plant extracts tested. Such extracts are more powerful anti-oxidants than vitamin E, and also exhibit potent cell-protective effects, which are linked to the well-known anti-ageing properties of anti-oxidants.

Introduction of chop-per-stabilized operational amplifiers with a complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor (C-MOS) input has brought about a much improved stability of the electronics. Such a feature has been found to be especially suitable for measurements requiring higher amplification and longer periods of time, e.g., the detection of the effects of various factors on bright-colored chromatophores. The use of appropriate color filters that limit the spectral range of light used for measurement has also proven to be important. By installing a small filter close to the photosensor, we can now record the responses of particular types of chromatophores more selectively, while visually monitoring the states of all kinds of chromatophores in natural color. To minimize the influence of motile activities of xanthophores and/or erythrophores, the use of an orange-to-red long-pass filter is appropriate to optimize recording the melanophore responses. By contrast, the responses of xanthophores or erythrophores can be recorded more easily by employing a violet-to-blue band-pass filter, because that increases the contrast of images of these cells against the background. Using an orange-red variety of the medaka Oryzias, we have also recorded photometrically the responses of leucophores, whose organelles are light-scattering. A long-pass filter was efficient in excluding the influences of co-existing xanthophores."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18494570"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0289-0003","MedlineTA":"Zoolog Sci","NlmUniqueID":"8702287","Country":"Japan"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"0289-0003-17-1-33","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"10.2108/zsj.17.33","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18494570","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"26","PubStatus":"received","Month":"7","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"17","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"8","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"23","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"23","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"23","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Methods From 1982 to January 1998, we used PDT to treat 140 patients with obstructive adeno or squamous carcinoma and evaluated survival up to November 1998. All patients had failed, refused, or were ineligible for surgery, ionizing radiation or chemotherapy. The effect of different variables on survival was estimated using multivariate analysis. The Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), weight, diet and complications were recorded and biopsies and brushings were taken at each endoscopy. At the beginning and end of each endoscopy the minimal diameter open of the esophagus, and the length, thickness and color of the tumor were recorded. Edema, exudate, bleeding, and mucositis were evaluated and recorded on an ordinal scale.Results The only significant variable affecting survival was the clinical stage. The median survival after PDT for all patients was 6.5 months (mean = 13.9). Kaplan-Meier survival after PDT curves were statistically significantly different when stratified by the clinical Stage at the time of PDT (p < 0.0001). Median survival (months) were for: Stage I = 56; Stage II = 12; Stage III = 6.5; Stage IV = 3.5. Analysis of each individual stage showed the KPS was the only confounding variable with a statistically significant effect on survival after PDT and this was only for Stages III and IV. The most significant effect occurred when the KPS was >/= 70. For Stage III the median survival when the KPS was >/= 70 was 7.7 months and for a KPS < 70 it was 5.0 months (p = 0.0001). For Stage IV the median survival when the KPS was >/= 70 was 5.5 months and for a KPS < 70 it was 2.5 months (p = 0.0002). The mean minimum diameter open before PDT was 6.2 mm (median 6.0mm) and at the end of the PDT treatment endoscopy 11.1 mm (median 12.0 mm) for a mean increase in the minimum diameter open of 4.9 mm (median 5.0 mm) This was statistically significant using paired t-tests (p < 0.0001).Conclusions Photodynamic therapy for esophageal carcinoma caused minimal complications and procedure related mortality. Complete obstruction can be relieved by the end of the PDT endoscopy.

Bronchoscopical PDT is performed with topical anesthesia approximately 48 h after the intravenous injection of 2.0 mg/kg body weight of Photofrin. Operation was performed 2-9 weeks after initial PDT. The initial purpose of PDT, i.e. either to reduce the extent of resection or convert inoperable disease to operable status, was achieved in 22 out of 26 patients treated. The survival rate of T3 (main bronchus invasion) cases treated by surgery alone increased significantly from 50.9% to 60.0% with the application of preoperative PDT.

Such mutants are described here as 'inherently resistant'. A novel laboratory method of selecting them from their parent populations is described. Selection may be achieved in a single in vivo passage in chickens. Decoquinate-resistant mutants were selected from a previously unexposed E. tenella strain: they tolerated < 0.625% w/w decoquinate in the food of chicks, whilst the rest of the population was sensitive to > 0.002% w/w. This single-passage method has a unique advantage over others; development of resistance to different drugs may be validly compared by using a single criterion, the lowest selective concentration (LSC), all other experimental factors remaining constant. Furthermore, the method is economical with time, facilities and experimental animals, and may have a predictive value in the choice of use concentrations for new anticoccidial agents. A potential selection index (PSI), the proposed or actual field use concentration of a drug divided by its LSC, is defined. It is suggested that a field use concentration for a new drug should be somewhat lower than the LSC, and the overall PSI for all Eimeria species and strains tested should therefore be < 1. In the present study, the PSI for decoquinate and E. tenella was 8.00, which is consistent with the very rapid development of resistance to quinolones that occurred in the field."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18484272"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0307-9457","MedlineTA":"Avian Pathol","NlmUniqueID":"8210638","Country":"England"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"784679825","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"10.1080/03079459808419353","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18484272","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

SS was induced in day-old broilers by an inoculum prepared from SS afflicted broilers. After onset of SS, immune responses (or absence of, in the case of tolerance) were studied by specific antibody production and T lymphocyte proliferation. Immune responses were induced by subcutaneous immunization of broilers against ss-casein or following natural exposure to enteric .E. coli.

This method involves intranasal administration of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to 1-day-old birds followed by three aerosol administrations of .E. coli at 3 to 4-day intervals. In four separate experiments there was no significant difference in virulence for a single isolate of .E. coli (E3) whereas four other field isolates of .E. coli ranged from highly virulent to avirulent. We also observed that the dominant .E. coli population isolated from 1-day-old birds in a flock of broiler breeders was highly virulent but that the dominant .E. coli population isolated from birds in the same flock 2 weeks later was avirulent. The dominant .E. coli population isolated from 1-day-old birds in this flock was sensitive to all of the antimicrobial agents tested whereas the dominant .E. coli population in the 2-week-old birds was multiresistant.

The internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) regions of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) from .Eimeria acervulina, E. brunetti, E. necatrix and .E. tenella were sequenced and regions of unique sequences identified. Four pairs of oligonucleotide primers, each designed to amplify the ITS1 region of a single .Eimeria species, were synthesised for use in the PCR assay. In tests on purified genomic DNA from all seven species of .Eimeria that infect the chicken, each of the four primer pairs amplified the ITS1 region from only their respective target species. The robustness of the approach was further demonstrated by the amplification of specific DNA fragments from tissues of experimentally infected animals and from oocysts recovered from field samples. We conclude that the ITS1 regions of .Eimeria species contain sufficient inter-specific sequence variation to enable the selection of primers that can be applied in PCR analyses to detect and differentiate between species.

The strains were found to be resistant to both drugs. In the laboratory, a dichotomous series of selection passages through chicks medicated with decoquinate or clopidol was used to demonstrate that both the original field populations of E, acervulina included at least some parasites that expressed simultaneous resistance to both drugs, rather than comprising subpopula-tions that were each resistant only to one drug or the other. This is the first time that a phenotypic analysis of the individuals in an eimerian population has been carried out. The relevance of this finding to the efficacy of Lerbek, a synergistic mixture of clopidol and methyl benzoquate (another quinolone), originally introduced in an attempt to delay the emergence of drug-resistant coccidia, is discussed. It is concluded that Lerbek would have been completely effective if resistance to neither of its components had already emerged before Lerbek was launched; some efficacy would also have been retained if resistance to only one of its components had already developed.

The lesions elsewhere included splenic necrosis with fibrinous exudation, fibrin thrombi in hepatic sinusoids, and fibrinopurulent epicardi-tis and perihepatitis which occasionally accompanied lesions in SHS cases. In Experiment 2, SPF chickens inoculated intranasally with turkey rhinotracheitis (TRT) virus and/or E. coli showed no significant lesions in the facial skin, upper respiratory tract or other organs.

Diagnosis implies the differentation of virulent and non-virulent Newcastle disease viruses (NDV). However, conventional methods, i.e. isolation of the virus and determination of the intracerebal pathogenicity index, take at least 5 days. Therefore, we investigated whether diagnosis can be performed by using the reverse transcrip-tase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on RNA isolated directly from tissue homogenate. Two oligonucleotide primers, representing the sequence at the cleavage site of the F protein of either virulent or non-virulent NDV strains, respectively, were used to differentiate NDV. Using the RT-PCR we were able to differentiate 15 NDV reference strains, 11 of which were virulent and 14 non-virulent. The RT-PCR was further validated by using homogenate of brain, trachea, lung and spleen from 12 chicken flocks and one turkey flock suspected of Newcastle disease. The RT-PCR detected virulent NDV in samples of seven flocks and non-virulent NDV in two out of three flocks in agreement with conventional methods. However the RT-PCR failed to detect virus in 1/3 flocks from which non-virulent virus was isolated. The results are discussed.

After about 70 hours an equilibrium is established between chloro and solvato monofunctional adducts at a ratio of 30/70. In the presence of excess GMP (4:1) the initially formed monofunctional adducts react further to give two bifunctional adducts, one with the iminoether ligands in their original E configurations and the other with the iminoether ligands having one E and the other, Z configurations.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acute zinc administration on TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), FT3 (free triiodothyronine), and FT4 (free tetraiodothyronine) in 10 healthy individuals and 12 hyperthyroid patients with Graves' disease. All these individuals were studied following 25 mg Zn(++) administered intravenously, at 7:00 a.m. after 12 h fast. Blood samples collected at 0, 3, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after zinc administration showed no significant alteration in the plasma levels of TSH, FT3, and FT4 in hyperthyroid patients. There were no changes in the plasma levels of FT3 and FT4 in the control subjects, but TSH levels were acutely depressed by zinc administration.

The platinated duplex was characterized by 1D and 2D proton NMR spectroscopy at 600 MHz. In agreement with previous studies by different techniques trans-EE was found to form a monofunctional adduct with the duplex involving the guanine residue. The modification by trans-EE has been found to induce only minor local distortion in the duplex geometry. Two key crosspeaks observed in the NOESY map corresponding to a close contact between G5-H8 and the methoxy and the methyl group, respectively, enabled us to dock the trans-EE complex with the duplex by geometry optimization. The results support the idea that the antitumor activity of trans-EE is related to lesion of DNA fundamentally different from that of cisplatin. Unexpectedly, the NOESY spectra indicated that at the high NaCl concentration used (0.2 M) the duplex was found to undergo slow deplatination. This was subsequently proved by HPLC. In a separate experiment on platination of the single strand in a salt free environment the HPLC analysis showed that the monofunctional adduct was not deplatinated, however, after 24 hours, additidnal minor isomers were detected."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"07","Year":"2011"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18475920"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0793-0291","MedlineTA":"Met Based Drugs","NlmUniqueID":"9505939","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1155/MBD.2000.23","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18475920","IdType":"pubmed"},{"value":"PMC2365194","IdType":"pmc"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"29","PubStatus":"received","Month":"11","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"25","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"11","Year":"1999"},{"Day":"14","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"14","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"14","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The agents did not alkylate bases of ct-DNA, cause intercalation between base pairs, produce cross linking of ct-DNA strands or generate free radicals although L1210 DNA fragmentation was observed after 24 hr incubation. L1210 DNA synthesis was preferentially inhibited which was achieved by (1) suppressing DNA polymerase alpha activity which reduced the synthesis of new strands of DNA, (2) reducing of de novo purine synthesis at the regulatory enzyme PRPP amido transferase which reduced d(GMP) levels, and (3) inhibiting of nucleoside kinase activities which further reduced DNA synthesis. DNA template activity was altered by the poly(phenolic)sulfonates since they reduced DNA polymerase alpha and m-RNA and t-RNA polymerase activities.

However, the prevalence of site-specific infection (i.e., oropharyngeal, vaginal, and esophageal candidiasis) can be quite variable depending on the immune status of the host. While vulvovaginal candidiasis is common in normal healthy women, oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis are more frequently encountered under immunocompromised states. Candida albicans, the causative agent in most cases of candidiasis, is a commensal organism of the gastrointestinal and lower female reproductive tracts. Thus, most healthy individuals have demonstrable Candida-specific immunity in the peripheral circulation. The pathogenic state is often precipitated by a deficiency or dysfunction in this immunity. Studies from animal models, women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, and HIV-infected individuals, however, suggest that distinct host defense mechanisms may function against oropharyngeal and vulvovaginal candidiasis. While cell-mediated immunity (CMI) appears important for protection against oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), there is little evidence to indicate that T cell-mediated immunity is protective against vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). Furthermore, whereas both local and systemically derived immune defenses appear important for protection against OPC, host defenses that protect against VVC appear limited to the local tissue and possibly restricted to innate mechanisms. Thus, current evidence suggests that VVC, unlike OPC, may not represent a strict opportunistic infection."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18473585"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1130-1406","MedlineTA":"Rev Iberoam Micol","NlmUniqueID":"9425531","Country":"Spain"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"1999168","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18473585","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"14","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"14","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"14","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The reactivity to paracoccidioidin was observed in 50% of children below ten years. Individuals who revealed reactivity to paracoccidiodin with prior history of coffee growing activities, and those reporting the grain collection as the main work, showed statistically significant association p = 0.0092, p = 0.0007 and p = 0,01 respectively.

These peptidases are latent and require appropriate activators. SDS has been widely used as an activator of these peptidases, but the mechanism of its activation remains unresolved. In this study, we investigated the kinetics of the SDS-activated hydrolysis of the above three types of peptidase of the 20S proteasome purified from Xenopus oocytes. When the reaction was started by simultaneous adding both SDS and substrate, maximal rates of hydrolysis were reached after appreciable lag phases with the trypsin-type substrate [t-butyloxycarbonylLeu-Arg-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Boc-LRR-MCA)], but no such lag phases were observed with the chymotrypsin-type and PGP hydrolase-type substrates [succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Suc-LLVY-MCA), and benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-2-naphthylamide (Cbz-LLE-2NA), respectively]. Similarly, changes in the hydrolysis rate to a reduced level upon dilution of SDS occurred after an appreciable lag phase again in the trypsin-like peptidase, but not in the other types. The lag phase characteristic of the trypsin-like peptidase was dependent on the substrate concentration. Thus, the lag phase was less discernible at very low concentrations of the substrate (e.g. at concentrations in the order of 1/100 of the Km value), but became more conspicuous with the increases in the substrate concentration. This lag phase also vanished upon preincubation of the activator (SDS) for a short period of 5 sec. These results suggest that the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex in the trypsin-like reaction induces a conformational change in the enzyme which makes the SDS activator site(s) in an occluded form, reducing the rates of SDS binding and dissociation."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18465998"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0289-0003","MedlineTA":"Zoolog Sci","NlmUniqueID":"8702287","Country":"Japan"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"0289-0003-15-3-353","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"10.2108/zsj.15.353","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18465998","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"11","PubStatus":"received","Month":"12","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"9","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"3","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"10","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"10","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"10","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"5","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Under constant light, a significantly higher percentage of 5,7-DHT injected animals showed arrhythmicity compared with the control group. An analysis carried by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electro-chemical detection (HPLC-ECD) revealed that the serotonin content in the optic lobe was significantly reduced to less than 50% in the 5,7-DHT injected animals, even one month after the injection.

A single pulse per 24 hr induced period modulation in a circadian phase dependent manner, yielding a period modulation curve (PMC): the 15 min light pulse lengthened the period in the early subjective night (CT11-16) and shortened it during the late subjective night to the early subjective day (CT20-5). Frequent light pulses modulated the freerunning period of the rhythm dependent on the interval of the pulses: when compared with the freerunning period in DD (23.74 +/- 0.03 hr) the period was significantly shorter in intervals of 2 and 4 hr, but lengthened when the interval was 1 and 12 hr. Frequent light pulses also resulted in entrainment of the rhythm to run with the period of 24 hr and the ratio of the entrained animals varied from 12% to 72% depending on the interval of the light pulses. The period modulation and the entrainment by the repetitive light pulses could be interpreted according to the PMC. In about 15% of animals, the light pulses induced a rhythm dissociation, suggesting that the bilaterally paired circadian pacemakers have their own sensitivity to the entraining photic information. The light pulse caused a masking effect, i.e., an intense burst of activity. The magnitude of the light induced responses was dependent on the circadian phase.

But which species are the same species as E. mathaei and E. oblonga as described by is still open to question. To answer this question, a field survey of genus Echinometra was made in Mauritius (the type locality of E. mathaei) according to the characteristics used to classify Okinawan Echinometra: appearance, pore pairs, spicules in gonads and tubefeet, sperm shape, and distribution on a reef. The results of crossfertilization between Echinometra from Mauritius and Okinawa are also reported. Mauritian Echinometra are classified into three groups which resemble Okinawan Echinometra sp. B, D, and violet spine color Echinometra. The latter has almost the same characteristics as Okinawan Echinometra sp. B but with violet spines, a spine color not found in Okinawa. In cross-fertilization experiments, the sperm of Mauritian Echinometra sp. B-like and violet Echinometra fertilized Okinawan Echinometra sp. B with almost 100% success. However, fertilization was unsuccessful with other Okinawan Echinometra species. Therefore, it could be said that Okinawan Echinometra sp. B is the same as Mauritian Echinometra sp. B-like, and the counterparts of Okinawan Echinometra sp. A and C are not distributed in Mauritius. The descriptions of E. mathaei most match Mauritian Echinometra sp. B-like and the type locality of E. mathaei is Mauritius. Thus, it is probable that Mauritian Echinometra sp. B-like is E. mathaei. Therefore, Okinawan Echinometra sp. B, which most resembles Mauritian Echinometra sp. B-like, would be also E. mathaei. Echinometra sp. A and C would be considered to be new species. Echinometra sp.

The traditional biomedical model emphasizes identification of pathology (diagnosis) and remediation of these biological deficits (treatment). An alternative approach, known as the outcomes model, focuses attention on the outcomes of health care. Specifically, health care is regarded as effective only if it extends life or if it improves quality of life. Indices that combine life expectancy and life quality can be used to monitor the benefits of health care. According to the traditional model, medical care is effective if it improves a clinical indicator (i.e. reduces blood pressure, decreases tumor size, etc.). According to the outcomes model, treatments are not advocated unless they improve general outcomes. There are circumstances in which clinical indicators improve but general outcomes remain the same or get worse. Data on the detection and treatment of prostate cancer are used to illustrate how these models might lead to different treatment decisions. According to the traditional model, aggressive screening and treatment of prostate cancer should be advocated because more cases are detected early and more tumors are removed. According to the outcomes model, net quality-adjusted life may be reduced rather than enhanced with screening. Shared medical decision-making is an outgrowth of the outcomes model. Using these methods, patients and providers integrate the best scientific evidence on treatment efficacy with patient preferences for outcomes. Often shared decision-making leads to reductions in the use of medical procedures."},"Language":"eng"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Adult","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Aged","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Chronic Disease","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"psychology","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"therapy","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Decision Support Techniques","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Delivery of Health Care","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Disease Progression","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Female","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Humans","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Lung Neoplasms","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"mortality","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"psychology","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"therapy","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Male","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Mass Screening","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"psychology","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Myocardial Infarction","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"mortality","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"psychology","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"therapy","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Outcome Assessment (Health Care)","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Patient Participation","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"psychology","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Prostatic Neoplasms","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"mortality","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"psychology","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"therapy","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Quality of Life","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"psychology","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Quality-Adjusted Life Years","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}}]},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"23","Month":"07","Year":"2008"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18425648"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0883-6612","MedlineTA":"Ann Behav Med","NlmUniqueID":"8510246","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1007/BF02895027","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18425648","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"24","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"7","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

These families were assayed with 151 marker loci that were polymorphic between the parents and a linkage map was constructed with Mapmaker analysis. A total of 32 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified for yield and the three component traits: 12 QTLs were detected in both years and the remaining 20 QTLs were observed in only one year. A search for the entire genome by using two-way analyses of variance with all possible two-locus combinations detected a very large number of significant digenic interactions involving both the QTLs resolved by single-locus analysis and loci that did not show significant effects by single-locus analysis. Many of the interactions were simultaneously detected in both years. Partitioning of the epistatic interactions recovered all three types of interactions, i. e. additive by additive, additive by dominance and dominance by dominance, for all the traits. Some of the epistatic interactions even showed pleiotropic effects by simultaneously affecting two or more traits. The results clearly indicate that epistasis plays a significant role in the inheritance of yield traits as well as in the genetic basis of heterosis."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"07","Year":"2011"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18425636"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1006-9305","MedlineTA":"Sci China C Life Sci","NlmUniqueID":"9611809","Country":"China"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1007/BF02895105","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18425636","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"20","PubStatus":"received","Month":"11","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"22","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The questions were related to the areas of evaluation, conservative management, dialysis therapy, and prognosis of ARF. There were 135 responses from 76 hospitals (69%); 37 of small size (< 150 beds), 21 of medium size (151-400 beds), and 18 of large size (401-1200 beds). There were 69 respondents from the small hospitals, 34 from the medium-sized, and 32 from the large hospitals. According to the respondents, the most encountered ARF patients were in the intensive care units and were most likely due to sepsis and nephrotoxic drugs. There were no differences among the respondents in the areas of initial evaluation, conservative and/or emergency treatment. However, the nephrologists were significantly more willing to follow-up their ARF patients and to carry more specific diagnostic procedures (i.e., renal biopsy) and specific advanced therapeutic procedures (i.e., dialysis), More ARF patients are being treated by continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) than intermittent hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The minority of the respondents believed that the prognosis of ARF had not improved much, despite the improvement in diagnosis and therapy. They attributed this to the change in the demographics of ARF, since more ICU and elderly patients are seen in practice. We conclude that nephrologists are indispensable for the management of acute renal failure. More efforts may be needed to recruit nephrologists to hospitals in Saudi Arabia. A local fellowship program may help in this regard. Furthermore, CRRT facilities, at least in the large hospitals, are required."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18408306"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1319-2442","MedlineTA":"Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl","NlmUniqueID":"9436968","Country":"Saudi Arabia"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"18408306","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Peritonitis remains the most significant complication of the procedure. Earlier rates of peritonitis were high, but after gaining sufficient experience, the rates are declining. To evaluate the change in peritonitis trend, 55 new patients who were recruited to our CAPD program between the periods October 1993-October 1996 were analyzed for the development of peritonitis on annual basis. There were 37 (67%) males and 18 (33%) females with a mean age of 43.3 years (range 12-72 years). A total of 34 episodes of peritonitis were recorded with a rate of 1.5 episode/patients year in 1993, 0.5 episode/patient year in 1994 and 0.8 in 1995. only 40% of episodes showed positive cultures whereas 60% remained culture-negative despite use of recommended modified culture techniques. Organisms causing peritonitis included staphylococcus eipdermides (6.7%), E. coli (3.3%), Streptococcus fecalis (3.3%) and pseudomonas (6.7%). Out of 34 episodes of peritonitis, 29 (85.3%) showed response to treatment and five episodes could only be treated after removal of catheter. Of the 29 episodes that responded to treatment, three relapsed and one had recurrent infection . However, all were successfully treated though one responded only after removal of catheter. Thus, a total of six catheters (20%) necessitated removal and replacement. In spite of high diabetic patients population in our series (27.2%) only one died of peritonitis related sepsis and another died of myocardial infarction after clearing the infection. Thus mortality remains low in spite of potential risk. Although we still use straight system CAPD rather than Y system peritonitis rates have declined considerable and we hope that the procedure will gain more acceptability amongst patients with ESRD in Saudi Arabia."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18408276"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1319-2442","MedlineTA":"Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl","NlmUniqueID":"9436968","Country":"Saudi Arabia"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"18408276","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Overall, our data support this third model, suggesting that PCOS is a familial disorder, with a single autosomal dominant gene effect, and a variable phenotype. Family history can then be considered as an important factor determining the risk of developing PCOS. Our preliminary data indicate that a woman's risk of developing PCOS is approximately 40% if her sister is affected. Alternatively, only 19% of mothers were affected, suggesting that the inheritance of PCOS may be preferentially paternal, although expanded clinical studies will be required to confirm these findings. Considering PCOS to be a dominant genetic disorder with a high degree of expressivity, we propose that the risk of developing the disorder is governed by family history and the degree of exposure to the selected environmental and/or other genetic influences."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"11","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18406241"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1043-2760","MedlineTA":"Trends Endocrinol Metab","NlmUniqueID":"9001516","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S1043-2760(98)00021-6","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18406241","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"4","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Thus, amlodipine is useful in patients with ischaemic LVD and heart failure without angina. The improvement in exercise capacity was greater in patients with scintigraphic evidence of viable and/or ischaemic myocardium and higher blood pressure. However, our study presented some limitations (i.e. an open study with few patients), and only generated a hypothesis that could lead to a wider, multicentre, cooperative trial. Treatment of patients with chronic ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) with heart failure symptoms but without angina is a difficult clinical problem. Despite the fact that surgical myocardial revascularisation may improve survival, most patients are not good candidates for surgery. Thus, 'polypharmacy' remains the principal option for these individuals. ACE inhibitors have become a cornerstone in the treatment of all forms of LVD, and have been demonstrated to improve functional class and survival. Nitrates, digitalis and diuretics are also commonly used for their effects on symptoms. Despite there being no evidence that calcium antagonists are useful for the treatment of heart failure or impaired ventricular function after myocardial infarction, these drugs are still prescribed to many patients with ischaemic LVD. However, it is possible that the concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors could reduce the reflex neurohumoral activity caused by some calcium antagonists, while preserving some of the beneficial properties of these agents. Among other calcium antagonists, amlodipine does not adversely affect the clinical status of patients. Some studies have shown that it reduces symptoms, improves exercise tolerance and does not result in neurohormonal stimulation. Moreover, amlodipine appears to have a mortality benefit in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy but not in patients with underlying coronary disease where it appears to have a 'neutral' effect. Thus, it is not clear whether amlodipine is useful in patients with ischaemic LVD, particularly in patients with silent coronary artery disease. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of amlodipine, in addition to standard therapy, in patients with ischaemic LVD and mild to moderate heart failure, assessing the effects of the drug on symptoms, LV function and exercise capacity."}]},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18370550"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-2563","MedlineTA":"Clin Drug Investig","NlmUniqueID":"9504817","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"160403","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18370550","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of levamisole on the immune response seen after presumed curative doses of praziquantel. After ethical approval, 29 male volunteers infected with Schistosoma haematobium were recruited and randomised to receive orally either (a) levamisole 5 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days, plus praziquantel 40 mg/kg as a single dose, (b) levamisole 5 mg/kg for 2 days, or (c) praziquantel 40 mg/kg as a single dose. Blood samples were collected on day 0 and again 3 months later for differential counts and specific IgG and IgE to whole-worm-antigen, as well as for the detection of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). Levamisole treatment alone resulted in a significant drop in circulating eosinophil counts, i.e. a median (95% confidence interval) drop of 6.0 (1;7)%. Eosinophil counts did not change significantly after praziquantel therapy alone. ECP values were significantly reduced with levamisole alone and praziquantel alone, i.e. respective median (95% confidence interval) drops of 33.58 (18.94; 55.9) and 16.54 (3.6; 33.5) microg/L (p < 0.05).

Furthermore, the increasing availability of new research and clinical information relevant to the treatment of these conditions means that continuing reappraisal of management strategies is necessary. Accordingly, the Ushuaia conference, Tierra Del Fuego, Argentina, was convened to discuss current approaches and future treatment prospects for patients with these conditions. The conference was comprised of leading Argentinian cardiologists whose primary aim was to formulate consensus recommendations regarding the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes. The first of the major recommendations for the pharmacological management of acute coronary syndromes arising from the Ushuaia Consensus Conference was that aspirin (200 to 500mg initially, then 100 to 325 mg/day) should be administered to all patients except those for whom aspirin is absolutely (or relatively, depending on the clinician's discretion) contraindicated. In such cases, ticlopidine is a suitable alternative. Intravenous nitrates are indicated for patients with angina pain (24 to 48 hours' duration), ECG changes, recurrence of angina, or signs of heart failure; in other cases, oral, transdermal or sublingual nitrates may be administered. Use of beta-blockers is recommended except when absolutely contraindicated or when there is a strong suspicion of vasospasm as a dominant mechanism in angina. Intravenous administration of these agents is preferred in patients with tachycardia, arterial hypertension or angina. Calcium antagonists are generally not recommended as first choice therapy, but can be indicated (preferably using agents that decrease heart rate) when beta-blockers are contraindicated or when there is a strong suspicion of vasospasm as a dominant mechanism in angina. Calcium antagonists are also useful in combination with other drugs in patients with high blood pressure or treatment-refractory recurrent angina. Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins and intravenous unfractionated heparin provide similar results and are indicated in a number of clinical situations. Emergency videocoronary angiography (VCA) is indicated in patients with persistent clinical and haemodynamic instability, recurrent ischaemia with heart failure, and refractory angina. Patients should also be referred for VCA if they have signs of left ventricular dysfunction, post-acute myocardial infarction angina with ECG changes, or ischaemia during functional studies. Post-VCA treatment will be determined by anatomical findings during VCA. Future prospects in the management of acute coronary syndromes include the development of more accurate prognostic markers and means of stratifying risk, such as sophisticated ECG criteria, serum markers of necrosis (e.g. troponin T and I), markers of thrombosis (e.g. D-dimer and fibrinopeptide A levels), markers of inflammation (e.g. reactive protein C, cell adhesion receptor expression, neopterine), and markers of 'good' prognosis (e.g. interleukin-10).

The study involved a 12-month double-blind, randomised, parallel-group design with a multicentric trial setting conducted by 64 participating physicians. 155 and 158 patients of either gender, aged between 18 and 70 years, were allocated to fluoxetine and medifoxamine, respectively. All patients had an acute depressive episode defined by the presence of at least five of the DSM III-R criteria with a minimal score of 25 on the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). All subjects had at least one previous documented depressive episode in their medical history. The main outcome criterion consisted of good therapeutic response defined by a sustained 50% reduction of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score combined with the absence of any serious or troublesome (i.e. intensity motivating study discontinuation) events. In the fluoxetine and medifoxamine groups, respectively, 45.2% and 43% of the randomised patients completed the 12-month follow-up period with no major differences between groups regarding the reasons for treatment withdrawal. With each treatment 58% of the patients reached at least a 50% decrease in their CGI score, with no differences on the evolution of the MADRS, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), the Self Rating Depression Scale of Zung (Zung scale) and Scott depression visual analogue scale (VAS) scores on average. According to the main efficacy criterion, 26% of the patients in the fluoxetine group were considered as responders compared with 36% in the medifoxamine group (p = 0.047). When only serious adverse effects were considered in combination with CGI scores to define response rates, the respective percentages were in favour of medifoxamine but the difference (45 vs 53%) was not significant. Results with medifoxamine were better in the elderly whereas, with fluoxetine, best responses were observed in younger patients. In conclusion, medifoxamine was an active and well tolerated drug in the continuation and maintenance treatment of depression. Its benefit/risk ratio appeared to be superior to fluoxetine, but this difference was mainly based on the occurrence of less minor adverse effects, a potential advantage not sufficient to favour better compliance with long-term therapy. Nevertheless, efficacy and tolerance of medifoxamine merits further evaluation in specific elderly populations."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18370483"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-2563","MedlineTA":"Clin Drug Investig","NlmUniqueID":"9504817","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"150404","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18370483","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The diagnosis of hepatitis was based on clinical, serological and histological data in all patients. A 'biochemical response' was defined as the normalisation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values, and a 'complete response' as the normalisation of ALT with disappearance of serum hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA. A 'sustained response' was defined as the persistence of ALT normalisation and undetectable viraemia 2 years after the end of treatment. The five groups were homogeneous. The incidence of dropouts was 8%, and IFN treatment was interrupted for adverse effects in 11% of the patients. In group A, 55% of the patients showed a 'biochemical response' and 31% of the subjects demonstrated a 'complete response'. In group B, a 'biochemical response' was observed in 61% and a 'complete response' in 36% of the cases. In group C, 77% of the subjects showed a 'biochemical response', with a 'complete response' seen in 40%. In group D, we observed a 'biochemical response' in 55% of the patients and a 'complete response' in 33%. In group E, 79% of the subjects had a 'biochemical response', and a 'complete response' was seen in 38%. At the end of the treatment-free follow-up the percentage of patients with a sustained response was 24% in group A, 28% in group B, 35% in group C, 27% in group D and 33% in group E. Therefore, a longer period of IFN treatment seems to provide higher percentages of sustained response than the usual 6-month duration, independently of the type of IFN. Moreover, the patients treated with a higher dosage (6MU 3 times weekly) for 6 months showed a slightly better sustained response rate compared with the usual dose. In conclusion, even if the differences among the response rates in the five groups were not statistically significant, we recommend a 12-month regimen, possibly using higher dosages at least in the first 4 to 6 months of treatment."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18370481"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-2563","MedlineTA":"Clin Drug Investig","NlmUniqueID":"9504817","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"150402","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18370481","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Inflammatory and non-inflammatory blisters were also induced to study the propensity of azithromycin to preferentially concentrate at a model infection site. 14 subjects participated in the two studies and tolerated azithromycin and the study methods well. Comodelling of the serum and urine data demonstrated very extensive distribution into peripheral compartments, low renal clearance (7% of total oral clearance) and an extended terminal half-life (79 hours). PMN leucocyte concentrations peaked at 119 mg/L following the final dose and remained above 60 mg/L 7 days after the final dose. The ratio of blister to serum AUCs was significantly higher in inflammatory (2.2) vs non-inflammatory (1.2) blisters (p < 0.02). The extensive uptake of azithromycin into PMNs coupled with the accumulation of azithromycin into an inflammatory compartment (e.g. infection site) support the hypothesis that PMN leucocytes laden with azithromycin migrate to sites of inflammation, thereby enhancing local concentrations.

A third-party payer perspective was adopted to compare the direct costs associated with the medication and healthcare resource use for each therapy over a period of 12 four-week cycles. The costs of routine patient care and the consequences of failure, in terms of relapses, acute therapies, hospitalisations and surgery, were included. The outcome was measured as the average number of days in remission per patient per 12-cycle period. Based on the assumptions in the model, the results show that budesonide CIR capsules are associated with a reduction of 16.6 (26%) days in relapse, i.e. a 6% increase in days in remission, over a one-year period compared with no maintenance therapy. Direct healthcare costs are increased by 6% or Swedish kronor (SEK) 1673 ($US1 ~ SEK7.60). Overall, the model shows that there are substantial (non-drug associated) cost offsets from using budesonide CIR capsules as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. These cost offsets, in addition to improvements in patients' well-being and quality of life, indicate that maintenance therapy is cost effective compared with no maintenance therapy. The cost per added day in remission is relatively modest (SEK101 ~ $US13). If indirect costs are added to the calculation, it is realistic to argue that a net saving to society would be most likely."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18370476"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-2563","MedlineTA":"Clin Drug Investig","NlmUniqueID":"9504817","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"150206","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18370476","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The drug was administered intramuscularly at a dosage of 1000 mg/day for the first 10 days, then orally at a dosage of 2000 mg/day for a further 20 days. Standard laboratory tests were used to evaluate safety and tolerability. Treatment efficacy was assessed clinically in the whole population, and in a subgroup of patients with 'lower than normal' baseline nerve conduction velocities (CVs), neurophysiological investigations were also performed at the end of the treatment period. After 30 days' therapy, there were no changes in vital signs or in blood tests. Only 18 patients reported poor tolerability of the treatment, mainly because of gastrointestinal events, and only 6 withdrew from the study because of these adverse events. The general and local (i.e. injection site) tolerability of LAC was rated highly by both patients and investigators. Neurological examination revealed that a significant percentage of patients with altered indices at baseline had normal indices by the end of the treatment period. The percentage of normalised patients varied from 11.9% for muscular trophism to 29.1% for the topographic score according to the different parameters taken into account in the neurological examination. Disease was rated as improved by 83.1% of investigators and 84.2% of patients. In patients with reduced CVs, significant increments were also recorded for motor and sensory nerves.

The calculated quantum-yield and spectral-responsivity values are compared with measurement results obtained by the study of a silicon trap detector and with values reported by other research groups. The comparisons show agreement with a standard deviation of 0.4% between our measured and modeled values for both the quantum yield and the spectral responsivity within the wavelength region from 260 to 400 nm. The proposed methods thus extend the predictability of the spectral responsivity of silicon photodetectors to the wavelength region from 260 to 950 nm. Furthermore, an explanation is proposed for the change in the spectral responsivity of silicon photodiodes that is due to UV radiation. In our improved quantum efficiency model the spectral change can be accounted for completely by the adjustment of just one parameter, i.e., the collection efficiency near the SiO(2)/Si interface."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"30","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18337863"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-6935","MedlineTA":"Appl Opt","NlmUniqueID":"0247660","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"64749","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18337863","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"14","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"14","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"14","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

This fully modeled inversion algorithm is then simplified to yield a hybrid modeled-unmodeled inversion algorithm in which the phycoerythrin (PE) absorption coefficient is retrieved as unmodeled 488-nm absorption (which exceeds the modeled phytoplankton and the CDOM-detritus absorption coefficients). Each algorithm was applied to water-leaving radiances, but only hybrid modeled-unmodeled inversions yielded viable retrievals of the PE absorption coefficient. Validation of the PE absorption coefficient retrieval was achieved by relative comparison with airborne laser-induced PEB fluorescence. The modeled-unmodeled retrieval of four inherent optical properties by direct matrix inversion is rapid and well conditioned, but the accuracy is strongly limited by the accuracy of the three principal inherent optical property models across all four spectral bands. Several research areas are identified to enhance the radiance-model-based retrievals: (a) improved PEB and PUB absorption coefficient models, (b) PE spectral shifts induced by PUB chromophore substitution at chromophore binding sites, (c) specific absorption-sensitive phytoplankton absorption modeling, (d) total constituent backscattering modeling, (e) unmodeled carotinoid and phycocyanin absorption that are not now accounted for in the chlorophyll-dominated phytoplankton absorption coefficient model, and (f) iterative inversion techniques to solve for six constituents with only five radiances. Although considerable progress has been made toward the satellite recovery of PE absorption, the maturity of the retrieval is presently insufficient for routine global application. Instead it must currently be used on a regional basis where localized ship and aircraft validation can be made available. The algorithm was developed for the MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor but is applicable to any sensor having comparable band locations."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"20","Month":"05","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18324297"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-6935","MedlineTA":"Appl Opt","NlmUniqueID":"0247660","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"60810","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18324297","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

To achieve high beam quality one must use single-mode diode lasers, however with the drawback of relatively low optical output powers from these components. To realize a high-power system while conserving the high beam quality of the individual emitters requires coherent coupling of the emitters. Such a power-scalable system consisting of 19 slave lasers that are injection locked by one master laser has been built and investigated, with low-power diode lasers used for system demonstration. The optical power of the 19 injection-locked lasers is coupled into polarization-maintaining single-mode fibers and geometrically superimposed by a lens array and a focusing lens. The phase of each emitter is controlled by a simple electronic phase-control loop. The coherence of each slave laser is stabilized by computer control of the laser current and guarantees a stable degree of coherence of the whole system of 0.7. An enhancement factor of 13.2 in peak power density compared with that which was achievable with the incoherent superposition of the diode lasers was observed."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"16","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18324087"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-6935","MedlineTA":"Appl Opt","NlmUniqueID":"0247660","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"60766","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18324087","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Comparisons with calculations performed by use of more rigorous electromagnetic wave theory show that the ray optics results agree to within a factor of 2 even for particle radii as small as twice the incident wavelength. Calculation of the forces for conditions typical of a total internal reflection microscopy experiment show that the evanescent field has a negligible effect on either the net forces exerted on the particle or the particle motion (i.e., rotation or translation parallel to the interface). By our modifying the parameters of the experiment, however--namely, the incident beam power, radius of incident beam, and evanescent wave penetration depth--forces that are comparable with the net particle weight and capable of translating the particle several micrometers per second, as well as rotating the particle several revolutions per second, can be produced.

The wave front under study is coherently superposed by a laterally sheared copy of itself, and from the interferogram difference measurements of the wave front are obtained. From these difference measurements the wave front is then reconstructed. Recently, several new and efficient algorithms for evaluating lateral shearing interferograms have been suggested. So far, however, all evaluation methods are somewhat restricted, e.g., assume a priori knowledge of the wave front under study, or assume small shears, and so on. Here a new, to our knowledge, approach for the evaluation of lateral shearing interferograms is presented, which is based on an extension of the difference measurements. This so-called natural extension allows for reconstruction of that part of the underlying wave front whose information is contained in the given difference measurements. The method is not restricted to small shears and allows for high lateral resolution to be achieved. Since the method uses discrete Fourier analysis, the reconstructions can be efficiently calculated. Furthermore, it is shown that, by application of the method to the analysis of two shearing interferograms with suitably chosen shears, exact reconstruction of the underlying wave front at all evaluation points is obtained up to an arbitrary constant. The influence of noise on the results obtained by this reconstruction procedure is investigated in detail, and its stability is shown. Finally, applications to simulated measurements are presented. The results demonstrate high-quality reconstructions for single shearing interferograms and exact reconstructions for two shearing interferograms."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"20","Month":"05","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18323994"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-6935","MedlineTA":"Appl Opt","NlmUniqueID":"0247660","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"43950","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18323994","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

However, in these conditions the inverse problem, i.e., calculation of localized absorption and the reduced scattering coefficients, is necessarily sensitive to the scattering phase function. This effect can be minimized if a new parameter of the phase function gamma, which depends on the first and the second moments of the phase function, is known. If gamma is unknown, an estimation of this parameter can be obtained by the measurement, but the uncertainty of the absorption coefficient is increased. A spatially resolved reflectance probe employing multiple detector fibers (0.3-1.4 mm from the source) is described. Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine gamma, the reduced scattering and absorption coefficients from reflectance data. Probe performance is assessed by measurements on phantoms, the optical properties of which were measured by other techniques [frequency domain photon migration (FDPM) and spatially resolved transmittance]. Our results show that changes in the absorption coefficient, the reduced scattering coefficient, and gamma can be measured to within +/-0.005 mm(-1), +/-0.05 mm(-1), and +/-0.2, respectively. In vivo measurements performed intraoperatively on a human skull and brain are reported for four NIR wavelengths (674, 811, 849, 956 nm) when the spatially resolved probe and FDPM are used. The spatially resolved probe shows optimum measurement sensitivity in the measurement volume immediately beneath the probe (typically 1 mm(3) in tissues), whereas FDPM typically samples larger regions of tissues.

The study involves materials with different thermal conductivities. By use of a reshaped irradiating beam obtained with a multifaceted integrating mirror, a three-dimensional numerical calculation allows us to establish both surface and in-depth temperature distributions. The results show that in the case of materials such as glass (i.e., with low thermal conductivity) large thermal gradients occur both on the surface and in depth during irradiation. However, the lateral heat flow is high enough to strongly reduce the surface gradients as soon as the laser irradiation ends.

The method is based on the existence of two specific incidence angles in the angular interference pattern of the p-polarized light where oscillations of the reflection coefficient cease. The first of these angles, theta(B1), is the well-known Abelès angle, i.e., the ambient-film Brewster angle, and the second angle theta(B2) is the film-substrate Brewster angle. In the conventional planar geometry and in a vacuum ambient there is a rigorous constraint epsilon(1) + epsilon > epsilon(1)epsilon on the film and the substrate dielectric permittivities epsilon(1) and epsilon, respectively, for the existence of the second angle theta(B2.) The limitation may be removed in an experiment by use of a cylindrical lens as an ambient with epsilon(0) > 1, so that both angles become observable. This, contrary to general belief, allows one to adopt the conventional Abelès method not only for films with epsilon(1) close to the substrate's value epsilon but also for any value of epsilon(1). The method, when applied to a wedge-shaped film or to any film of unknown variable thickness, permits one to determine (i) the refractive index of a film on an unknown substrate, (ii) the vertical and the horizontal optical anisotropies of a film on an isotropic substrate, (iii) the weak absorption of a moderately thick film on a transparent or an absorbing isotropic substrate."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"09","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18323897"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-6935","MedlineTA":"Appl Opt","NlmUniqueID":"0247660","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"44331","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18323897","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Waveform distortions of 5.5lambda and 18.5lambda between the optical axis and the 1/e(2) irradiance values of the laser beam were introduced by replacement of laser achromats in the delivery system by planoconvex lenses. Aberrations of 18.5lambda increased the energy threshold for plasma formation by a factor of 8.5 compared with the optimized system. The actual irradiance threshold for optical breakdown was determined from the threshold energy in the optimized system and the spot size measured with a knife-edge technique. For aberrations of 18.5lambda the irradiance threshold was 48 times larger than the actual threshold when it was calculated by use of the diffraction-limited spot size but was 35 times smaller when it was calculated by use of the measured spot size. The latter discrepancy is probably due to hot spots in the focal region of the aberrated laser beam. Hence the determination of the optical-breakdown threshold in the presence of aberrations leads to highly erroneous results. In the presence of aberrations the plasmas are as much as 3 times longer and the transmitted energy is 17-20 times higher than without aberrations. Aberrations can thus strongly compromise the precision and the safety of intraocular microsurgery. They can further account for a major part of the differences in the breakdown-threshold and the plasma-transmission values reported in previous investigations."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"10","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18319968"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-6935","MedlineTA":"Appl Opt","NlmUniqueID":"0247660","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"44311","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18319968","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"6","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"6","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"6","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"3","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The EKF approach enables one to overcome the intrinsic limitations of standard straightforward nonmemory procedures such as the slope method, exponential curve fitting, and the backward inversion algorithm. Whereas those procedures are inherently not adaptable because independent inversions are performed for each return signal and neither the statistics of the signals nor a priori uncertainties (e.g., boundary calibrations) are taken into account, in the case of the Kalman filter the filter updates itself because it is weighted by the imbalance between the a priori estimates of the optical parameters (i.e., past inversions) and the new estimates based on a minimum-variance criterion, as long as there are different lidar returns. Calibration errors and initialization uncertainties can be assimilated also. The study begins with the formulation of the inversion problem and an appropriate atmospheric stochastic model. Based on extensive simulation and realistic conditions, it is shown that the EKF approach enables one to retrieve the optical parameters as time-range-dependent functions and hence to track the atmospheric evolution; the performance of this approach is limited only by the quality and availability of the a priori information and the accuracy of the atmospheric model used.

Whether these profiles can be retrieved determines whether a submillimetric instrument can be self-sufficient as far as the atmospheric model is concerned or whether complementary sensors in other spectral regions, dedicated to temperature and pressure measurements, are needed. Molecular-oxygen transitions are selected for the purpose of temperature and pressure retrieval on the basis of realistic observational parameters. We use a mathematical model of the retrieval process to evaluate the information content of the spectral features and to study the trade-off between the uncertainty of the retrieved profiles and their vertical resolution. It is shown that, using only one oxygen transition and without any constraint, one can achieve uncertainties of 5% for both temperature and pressure from 10 to approximately 40 km of altitude with a vertical resolution of 3 km; above 40 km the vertical resolution needs to be degraded to limit the uncertainties. The possibility of exploiting a priori information is discussed, as well as the effects of external constraints that can be used to improve the quality of the retrieved profiles.

Bandwidth calibration curves for a minimum spectral transmission factor relative to the spectral bandwidth of the reference spectrophotometer are derived for the absorption bands at the wavelength of the band absorption maximum. The family of these calibration curves characterizes the spectral bandwidth standard. We calibrate the spectral bandwidth of a spectrophotometer with respect to the reference spectrophotometer by determining the spectral transmission factor minimum at every calibrated absorption band of the bandwidth standard for the nominal instrument values of the spectral bandwidth. With reference to the standard spectral bandwidth calibration curves, the relation of the spectral bandwidth to the reference spectrophotometer is determined.

A community-based census identified 3057 age-eligible individuals of whom 2092 individuals (68.4%) agreed to participate in the overall study. Of these, 1101 subjects between 55 and 94 years of age who were free of known heart disease and able to perform treadmill exercise were tested using the Cornell protocol. Of these 1101 subjects, 73.8% of women and 89.5% of men (p < .001) exceeded what was considered a minimal threshold workload [i.e., > or =2 min of exercise and a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) > or = 1.00]. Moreover, 32.9% of women and 52.7% of men achieved a RER > or = 1.10 and were considered to have achieved maximal exercise. For all subjects who exceeded the minimal exercise workload, the mean exercise duration was 10.0 +/- 4.0 min for women and 13.2 +/- 4.6 min for men. Peak VO2/kg x min(-1) decreased linearly with age for both women (y = 38.33 - 0.27 x age + 1.12 H) and men (y = 41.78 - 0.26 x age + 12.65 H - 0.15 H x age), (p < .001 for sex difference), where H is defined as presence (=1) or absence (=0) of a disease condition. However, this sex-related difference disappeared when VO2/kg x min(-1) was adjusted for lean body mass. Thus, from a community-based sample of older persons, we have provided data (by 5-year age groups) for rates of participation in treadmill exercise testing and the success rate for achieving maximal exercise.

For example, the CDOM absorption coefficient IOP a(CDOM)(lambda(i)) = a(CDOM)(lambda(ref))exp[-S(lambda(i)- lambda(ref))] is linear in a(CDOM)(lambda(ref)) and nonlinear in S. Upon linearization by Taylor's series expansion, it is shown that spectral model parameters, such as S, can be concurrently accommodated within the same conventional linear matrix formalism used to retrieve the reference wavelength IOP's. Iteration is used to adjust for errors caused by truncation of the Taylor's series expansion. Employing an iterative linear matrix inversion of a water-leaving radiance model, computer simulations using synthetic data suggest that (a) no instabilities or singularities are introduced by the linearization and subsequent matrix inversion procedures, (b) convergence to the correct value can be expected only if starting values for a model parameter are within certain specific ranges, (c) accurate retrievals of the CDOM slope S (or the phytoplankton Gaussian width g) are generally reached in 3-20 iterations, (d) iterative retrieval of the exponent n of the TCB wavelength ratio spectral model is not recommended because the starting values must be within approximately +/-5% of the correct value to achieve accurate convergence, and (e) concurrent retrieval of S and g (simultaneously with the phytoplankton, CDOM, and TCB coefficient IOP's) can be accomplished in a 5 x 5 iterative matrix inversion if the starting values for S and g are carefully chosen to be slightly higher than the expected final retrieved values."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"10","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18305786"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-6935","MedlineTA":"Appl Opt","NlmUniqueID":"0247660","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"44033","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18305786","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"29","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

With the absorption of solar radiation and the emission of thermal radiation considered the static and dominant factors that determine the equilibrium temperature of a spherical object, a simple model is formulated. Realistic variations of the two material-dependent parameters, solar absorptance alpha and hemispherical emittance epsilon, permit a large change in the equilibrium temperature, from less than -50 to more than +150 degrees C. It is pointed out that for a generalized gray surface, i.e., one made from a material whose reflectance-emittance has the same value within the visible and the thermal wavelength regions, the equilibrium temperature is approximately 5 degrees C, independent of the numerical value of the reflectance. With the requirement for electrical conductivity also taken into account, TiN alloys are identified as candidate materials. Measurements and calculations of some of them indicate that this group may contain a material that fulfills all the requirements.

A perturbation approach is introduced for the optical properties. Here we can strongly reduce the number of free variables of the inverse problem by exploiting a priori information such as the search for single inhomogeneities within a relatively homogeneous object, a typical situation for breast cancer detection. We achieve higher accuracy and a considerable reduction in computational effort by solving a parabolic differential equation for a perturbation density, i.e., the difference between the photon density in an inhomogeneous object and the density in the homogeneous case being given by an analytic expression.

An in-line holographic setup is used in which the reference beam is reflected from a blazed reflection grating, i.e., a Littrow setup. By this method a relatively large optical delay is created between the reference and the object beams even with a small object-reference angle, which is necessary because of the limited resolution of the CCD. The delay varies continuously across one axis of the CCD array. In this way different object sections are reconstructed from different parts of the CCD, which in turn correspond to a certain path length from the object.

The accuracy was measured as a function of the size parameter and the refractive index of the sphere and as a function of the cube size used in the simulations. The size parameter of the sphere was as large as 10, and three refractive indices were considered. The errors in the internal field are located mostly on the surface of the sphere, and even for fine discretizations they remain relatively large. The errors depend strongly on the refractive index of the particle. If the discretization is kept constant, the errors depend only weakly on the size parameter.

First, we introduced the issue from a theoretical point of view by using both an EKF formulation and an appropriate atmospheric stochastic model; second, it is tested through extensive simulation and under simplified conditions; and, finally, a first real application is discussed. An atmospheric model including both temporal and spatial correlation features is introduced to describe approximate fluctuation statistics in the sought-after atmospheric optical parameters and hence to include a priori information in the algorithm. Provided that reasonable models are given for the filter, inversion errors are shown to depend strongly on the atmospheric condition (i.e., the visibility) and the signal-to-noise ratio along the exploration path in spite of modeling errors in the assumed statistical properties of the atmospheric optical parameters. This is of advantage in the performance of the Kalman filter because they are often the point of most concern in identification problems. In light of the adaptive behavior of the filter and the inversion results, the EKF approach promises a successful alternative to present-day nonmemory algorithms based on exponential-curve fitting or differential equation formulations such as Klett's method."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18301520"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-6935","MedlineTA":"Appl Opt","NlmUniqueID":"0247660","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"43558","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18301520","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"28","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"28","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"28","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

We explore the efficacy of using a simple model of the aerosol-a Junge power-law size distribution consisting of homogeneous spheres with arbitrary refractive index-in a nonlinear optimization procedure for estimating the relevant oceanic and atmospheric parameters for case 1 waters. Using simulated test data generated from more realistic aerosol size distributions (sums of log-normally distributed components with different compositions), we show that the ocean's pigment concentration (C) can be retrieved with good accuracy in the presence of weakly or strongly absorbing aerosols. However, because of significant differences in the scattering phase functions for the test and power-law distributions, large error is possible in the estimate of the aerosol optical thickness. The positive result for C suggests that the detailed shape of the aerosol-scattering phase function is not relevant to the atmospheric correction of ocean color sensors. The relevant parameters are the aerosol single-scattering albedo and the spectral variation of the aerosol optical depth. We argue that the assumption of aerosol sphericity should not restrict the validity of the algorithm and suggest an avenue for including colored aerosols, e.g., wind-blown dust, in the procedure.

This approach offers advantages in the control of unobserved modes, the elimination of unwanted modes (e.g., tip and tilt), and automatic handling of the case of low-resolution lens arrays. In our two-step modal implementation, the input vector of gradients is first decomposed into a Zernike polynomial mode by a least-squares estimate. The number of modes is assumed to be less than or equal to the number of actuators. The mode coefficients are then available for collection and analysis or for the application of modal weights. Thus the modal weights may be changed quickly without recalculating the full matrix. The control-loop integrators are at this point in the algorithm. To calculate the deformable-mirror drive signals, the mode coefficients are converted to the zonal signals by a matrix multiply. When the number of gradients measured is less than the number of actuators, the integration in the control loop will be done on the lower-resolution grid to avoid growth of unobserved modes.

Typically, these MRF models have parameters that allow the prior model to be adjusted for best performance. However, optimal estimation of these parameters(sometimes referred to as hyper parameters) is difficult in practice for two reasons: i) direct parameter estimation for MRF's is known to be mathematically and numerically challenging; ii)parameters can not be directly estimated because the true image cross section is unavailable.In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient scheme to address both these difficulties for a general class of MRF models,and we derive specific methods of parameter estimation for the MRF model known as generalized Gaussian MRF (GGMRF).The first section of the paper derives methods of direct estimation of scale and shape parameters for a general continuously valued MRF. For the GGMRF case, we show that the ML estimate of the scale parameter, sigma, has a simple closed-form solution, and we present an efficient scheme for computing the ML estimate of the shape parameter, p, by an off-line numerical computation of the dependence of the partition function on p.The second section of the paper presents a fast algorithm for computing ML parameter estimates when the true image is unavailable.

The estimation of the correspondences-two-dimensional (2-D) motion field-between the frames and segmentation of the scene into objects are achieved simultaneously by minimizing a Gibbs energy. The depth field is estimated by jointly minimizing a defined distortion and bit-rate criterion using the 3-D motion parameters. The resulting depth field is efficient in the rate-distortion sense. Bit-rate values corresponding to the lossless encoding of the resultant depth fields are obtained using predictive coding; prediction errors are encoded by a Lempel-Ziv algorithm.

However, one can obtain more accurate results if one applies a filter prior to sampling, a fact well known from sampling theory. The optimal solution corresponds to an orthogonal projection onto the underlying continuous signal space. Unfortunately, the optimal projection prefilter is difficult to implement when sine or high order spline functions are used. We propose to resize the image using an oblique rather than an orthogonal projection operator in order to make use of faster, simpler, and more general algorithms. We show that we can achieve almost the same result as with the orthogonal projection provided that we use the same approximation space. The main advantage is that it becomes perfectly feasible to use higher order models (e.g. splines of degree n=or>3). We develop the theoretical background and present a simple and practical implementation procedure using B-splines. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms the standard interpolation methods and that it provides essentially the same performance as the optimal procedure (least squares solution) with considerably fewer computations. The method works for arbitrary scaling factors and is applicable to both image enlargement and reduction."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"29","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18276284"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1057-7149","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Image Process","NlmUniqueID":"9886191","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/83.668025","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18276284","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"16","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"16","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"16","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

This inverse problem is ill-posed and we resolve it by incorporating the prior information that the reconstructed objects are composed of smooth regions separated by sharp transitions. This feature is modeled by a piecewise Gaussian (PG) Markov random field (MRF), known also as the weak-string in one dimension and the weak-membrane in two dimensions. The reconstruction is defined as the maximum a posteriori estimate. The prerequisite for the use of such a prior is the success of the optimization stage. The posterior energy corresponding to a PG MRF is generally multimodal and its minimization is particularly problematic. In this context, general forms of simulated annealing rapidly become intractable when the observation operator extends over a large support. In this paper, global optimization is dealt with by extending the graduated nonconvexity (GNC) algorithm to ill-posed linear inverse problems. GNC has been pioneered by Blake and Zisserman in the field of image segmentation. The resulting algorithm is mathematically suboptimal but it is seen to be very efficient in practice. We show that the original GNC does not correctly apply to ill-posed problems. Our extension is based on a proper theoretical analysis, which provides further insight into the GNC.

An alternating minimization (AM)implicit iterative scheme is devised to recover the image and simultaneously identify the point spread function (psf). Numerical results indicate that the iterative scheme is quite robust, converges very fast (especially for discontinuous blur), and both the image and the psf can be recovered under the presence of high noise level.

We show that such mappings can be achieved by either inserting delays or by varying the threshold voltage. The result is that to achieve a linear mapping it is much more favorable to use a variable threshold since the processing power of the sensor is then better utilized.

We use visible-IR pairs of correlated photons produced by means of optical parametric downconversion to measure the radiance of a high-temperature IR source at 3.415 and 4.772 mum in an intrinsically absolute manner (i.e., without requiring any externally calibrated radiometric standard). To our knowledge, this is the only radiometric method with which one measures radiance directly, instead of using radiant power and aperture geometry measurements to deduce radiance indirectly. This technique has an additional unusual characteristic: It allows absolute radiometric measurements of IR radiation to be made with high-quality visible detectors. We compare measurements made with this technique with radiance measurements made with conventional means tied to existing radiometric standards. These comparisons show an average agreement to within ~3% between the two methods. The results demonstrate an accuracy consistent with the estimated uncertainty of the currentmeasurements. This is the first time to our knowledge that this method has been used to provide absolute radiance measurements of a source that has been calibrated conventionally, revealing unexpected systematic effects and allowing estimates of the ultimate accuracy of this method. In addition, these measurements are further into the IR than any previous measurements of this process and have produced the highest thermally stimulated downconversion signal yet seen."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18273309"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-6935","MedlineTA":"Appl Opt","NlmUniqueID":"0247660","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"64758","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18273309","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

To this end the light-scattering history of a vaporizing droplet under unsteady conditions is discussed. Unlike in previous papers, the reduction of the droplet's diameter is also taken into account in addition to the variation of the refractive-index profile. A finely stratified sphere model with thousands of layers (i.e., 20,000) is used to compute the scattering patterns of a radially inhomogeneous evaporating droplet at different heating times and therefore with different diameters and refractive-index profiles. In the studied case the temperatures inferred from rainbow thermometry do not represent the actual temperatures inside the droplet. They do not represent an average internal temperature or even the surface or the core temperature. For droplets with a temperature that increases from the core to the surface, the inferred values are always lower than the minimum temperature inside the droplet. Therefore the rainbow technique should be applied with caution in all cases in which droplet inhomogeneities are suspected. In addition, a careful analysis of the scattering in the rainbow region is presented. Because of the physical structure of the rainbow, a marked uncertainty in the inferred temperatures also has to be considered in the case of homogenous droplets. For inhomogeneous spheres this intrinsic uncertainty has to be added to the effects caused by the internal profiles of the refractive index."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"16","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18273274"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-6935","MedlineTA":"Appl Opt","NlmUniqueID":"0247660","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"43422","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18273274","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"15","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

An inversion statistical method has thus been developed and applied to the direct determination of the radiative forcing of methane, based on such instruments as the Fourier-transform Interferometric Monitor for Greenhouse Gases launched onboard the Japanese Advanced Earth Observing Satellite in 1996 and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer planned for the European polar platform Meteorological Operational Satellite in 2000. The method is based on simple statistical laws that directly relate the measured radiances to the radiative forcing by use of an a priori selection of appropriate spectral intervals and global modeling of methane spatial variations. This procedure avoids the use of an indirect determination based on an inversion process that requires precise knowledge of the methane vertical profiles throughout the troposphere. The overall accuracy and precision of this new algorithm are studied, and interfering gases and instrumental characteristics are taken into account.

This method is a powerful tool thatmakes it possible to study the influence of cell shape on the angulardistribution of scattered light. General observations were that thethree-dimensional shape, as well as the optical thickness apparent tothe incident field, affects the forward scattering. Thebackscattering was influenced by the shape of the surface facing theincident beam. Furthermore sphering as well as elongation of anoblate RBC into a volume-equivalent sphere or a prolate spheroid, respectively, was theoretically modeled to imitate physiologicalphenomena caused, e.g., by heat or the increased shear stress offlowing blood. Both sphering and elongation were shown to decreasethe intensity of the forward-directed scattering, thus yielding lowerg factors. The sphering made the scattering patternindependent of azimuthal scattering angle phi(s), whereas the elongation induced more apparent phi(s)-dependent patterns. The lightscattering by a RBC volume-equivalent spheroid was thus found to behighly influenced by the shape of the scattering object. Anear-field radius r(nf) was evaluated as thedistance to which the maximum intensity of the total near field haddecreased to 2.5 times that of the incident field. It was estimatedto 2-24.5 times the maximum radius of the scattering spheroid, corresponding to 12-69 mum. Because the near-field radiuswas shown to be larger than a simple estimation of the distance betweenthe RBC's in whole blood, the assumption of independent scattering, frequently employed in optical measurements on whole blood, seemsinappropriate.

The retrieval algorithm iteratively corrects the aerosol volume scattering function, the product of the single-scattering albedo and the phase function, based on the difference between the measured sky radiance and the radiance calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation. It is tested first under ideal conditions, i.e., the approximations made in the retrieval algorithm totally agree with actual conditions assumed in creating the pseudodata for sky radiance. It is then tested under more realistic conditions to assess its susceptibility to measurement errors and effects of conditions not recognized in the retrieval algorithm, e.g., surface horizontal inhomogeneity, departures of the surface from Lambertian, and aerosol horizontal inhomogeneity. These simulations show that, in most cases, this scheme can retrieve the aerosol single-scattering albedo with high accuracy (within 1%) and can therefore be used to identify strongly absorbing aerosols. It can also produce meaningful retrievals of most aerosol phase functions: less than 5% error at 865 nm and less than 10% at 443 nm in most cases. Typically, the error in the volume scattering function is small for scattering angles ?90 degrees , then increases for larger angles. Disappointing results in both the single-scattering albedo and the scattering phase function occur at 443 nm, either when there are large calibration errors in the radiometer used to measure the sky radiance or when the land reflection properties are significantly inhomogeneous."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18268674"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-6935","MedlineTA":"Appl Opt","NlmUniqueID":"0247660","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"43344","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18268674","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The second method is based on the use of the Azzam universal relationship between the Fresnel s- and p-reflection coefficients. For a flat surface and an isotropic medium, the Azzam combination of coefficients becomes zero and thus is independent of the incidence angle, whereas for a uniaxial or biaxial anisotropic sample it acquires a certain angular dependence, which may be used to determine the anisotropy of the sample. Finally, for those cases in which the anisotropy of the material of a film deposited on an isotropic substrate is itself of interest, a third method, the interference method, is suggested.

The degree of convergence is related to the distribution of the directions of the gradient vectors and not to their magnitudes. The convergence index of a gradient vector at a given pixel is defined as the cosine of its orientation with respect to the line connecting the pixel and the pixel of interest. The output of the iris filter is the average of the convergence indices within its region of support and lies within the range [-1,1]. The region of support of the iris filter changes so that the degree of convergence of the gradient vectors in it becomes a maximum, i.e., the size and shape of the region of support at each pixel of interest changes adaptively according to the distribution pattern of the gradient vectors around it. Theoretical analysis using models of a rounded convex region and a semi-cylindrical one is given. These show that rounded convex regions are generally enhanced, even if the contrast to their background is weak and also that elongated objects are suppressed. The filter output is 1/pi at the boundaries of rounded convex regions and semi-cylindrical ones. This value does not depend on the contrast to their background. This indicates that boundaries of rounded or slender objects, with weak contrast to their background, are enhanced by the iris filter and that the absolute value of 1/pi can be used to detect the boundaries of these objects. These theoretical characteristics are confirmed by experiments using X-ray images."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"15","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18267518"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1057-7149","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Image Process","NlmUniqueID":"9886191","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/83.777084","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18267518","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The affine invariants are constructed from the areas of the triangles formed by connecting three vertices among a set of four consecutive vertices (quadruplets) of the convex hull, and hence do make direct use of the area invariance property associated with the affine transformation. Because they are locally constructed, they are very well suited to handle the occlusion and/or appearance of new objects. These invariants are used to establish the correspondences between the convex hull vertices of a test image with a reference image in order to undo the affine transformation between them.

We denote such a coding strategy as rate-distortion optimized embedding (RDE). RDE allocates the available coding bits first to the coefficient with the steepest R-D slope, i.e., the largest distortion decrease per coding bit. The resultant coding bitstream can be truncated at any point and still maintain an optimal R-D performance. To avoid the overhead of coding order transmission, we use the expected R-D slope, which can be calculated from the coded bits and is available in both the encoder and the decoder. With the probability estimation table of the QM-coder, the calculation of the R-D slope can be just a lookup table operation.

Diagonal preconditioners offer some improvement in convergence rate, but do not incorporate the structure of the Hessian matrices in imaging problems. Circulant preconditioners can provide remarkable acceleration for inverse problems that are approximately shift-invariant, i.e., for those with approximately block-Toeplitz or block-circulant Hessians. However, in applications with nonuniform noise variance, such as arises from Poisson statistics in emission tomography and in quantum-limited optical imaging, the Hessian of the weighted least-squares objective function is quite shift-variant, and circulant preconditioners perform poorly. Additional shift-variance is caused by edge-preserving regularization methods based on nonquadratic penalty functions. This paper describes new preconditioners that approximate more accurately the Hessian matrices of shift-variant imaging problems. Compared to diagonal or circulant preconditioning, the new preconditioners lead to significantly faster convergence rates for the unconstrained conjugate-gradient (CG) iteration.

The proposed methodology operates as an ideal interface between the signals formed by a focused beamforming technique (i.e., the beam signals) and the related image, whether a two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) one. To this end, a reliability measure has been introduced, called confidence, which allows one to perform a rapid examination of the beam signals and is aimed at accurately detecting echoes backscattered from a scene. The confidence-based approach exploits the physics of the process of image formation and generic a priori knowledge of a scene to synthesize model-based signals to be compared with actual backscattered echoes, giving, at the same time, a measure of the reliability of their similarity. The objectives that can be attained by this method can be summarized in a reduction in artifacts due to the lowering of the side-lobe level, a better lateral resolution, a greater accuracy in range determination, a direct estimation of the reliability of the information acquired, thus leading to a higher image quality and hence a better scene understanding. Tests on both simulated and actual data (concerning both 2-D and 3-D images) show the higher efficiency of the proposed confidence-based approach, as compared with more traditional techniques."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"16","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18267473"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1057-7149","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Image Process","NlmUniqueID":"9886191","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/83.743860","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18267473","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"13","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

It therefore fills the primary set with symbols that have occurred in the previously. Symbols move dynamically between the two symbol sets to adapt to the local statistics of the symbol source. The proposed method works well for sources, such as images, that are characterized by large alphabets and alphabet distributions that are skewed and highly nonstationary. We analyze the performance of the proposed method and compare it to other arithmetic coding methods, both theoretically and experimentally.

In this paper, we combine the block structure of the underlying dynamical models and the sparseness of the measurements (e.g., satellite scans) to develop four efficient implementations of the KBf that reduce its computational cost to O(I(5)) in the case of the block KBf and the scalar KBf, and to O(I(4)) in the case of the local block KBf (lbKBf) and the local scalar KBf (lsKBf).

In this paper, the PHMM is extended to multiple sequences with a multiple token version and adaptive versions of PHMM coding are presented. The different versions of the PHMM are applied to lossless bilevel image coding. To reduce and optimize the model cost and size, the contexts are organized in trees and effective quantization of the parameters is introduced. The new coding methods achieve results that are better than the JBIG standard on selected test images, although at the cost of increased complexity. By the minimum description length principle, the methods presented for optimizing the code length may apply as guidance for training (P)HMMs for, e.g., segmentation or recognition purposes.

We prove that our more general algorithm is globally convergent (i.e., converges to a local minimum from any initialization) under less restrictive conditions, even when the original cost functional is nonconvex. We apply this algorithm to tomographic reconstruction from limited-angle data by formulating the problem as one of regularized least-squares optimization. The results demonstrate that the constraint of piecewise smoothness, applied through the use of edge-preserving regularization, can provide excellent limited-angle tomographic reconstructions. Two edge-preserving regularizers-one convex, the other nonconvex-are used in numerous simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm under various limited-angle scenarios, and to explore how factors, such as the choice of error norm, angular sampling rate and amount of noise, affect the reconstruction quality and algorithm performance.

An improvement to this algorithm is described in which the spectral variation of optical depth is calculated as a function of aerosol type and relative humidity, and an attempt is made to retrieve the relative humidity in addition to aerosol type.

Such measurements are incapable of distinguishing between weakly and strongly absorbing aerosols, and the atmospheric correction and aerosol retrieval algorithms fail if the incorrect absorption properties of the aerosol are assumed. We present an algorithm that appears promising for the retrieval of in-water biophysical properties and aerosol optical properties in atmospheres containing both weakly and strongly absorbing aerosols. By using the entire spectrum available to most ocean color instruments (412-865 nm), we simultaneously recover the ocean's bio-optical properties and a set of aerosol models that best describes the aerosol optical properties. The algorithm is applied to simulated situations that are likely to occur off the U.S. East Coast in summer when the aerosols could be of the locally generated weakly absorbing Maritime type or of the pollution-generated strongly absorbing urban-type transported over the ocean by the winds. The simulations show that the algorithm behaves well in an atmosphere with either weakly or strongly absorbing aerosol. The algorithm successfully identifies absorbing aerosols and provides close values for the aerosol optical thickness. It also provides excellent retrievals of the ocean bio-optical properties. The algorithm uses a bio-optical model of case 1 waters and a set of aerosol models for its operation. The relevant parameters of both the ocean and atmosphere are systematically varied to find the best (in a rms sense) fit to the measured top-of-the-atmosphere spectral reflectance. Examples are provided that show the algorithm's performance in the presence of errors, e.g., error in the contribution from whitecaps and error in radiometric calibration."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18264417"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0003-6935","MedlineTA":"Appl Opt","NlmUniqueID":"0247660","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"63104","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18264417","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

We performed a simulation study using a matrix method to calculate relative transmittance and the amount of phase shift of light through the PSM. However, we found that the average film composition changed with deposition time. Accordingly, optical constants were found to be a strong function of film thickness. Therefore we rearranged the relationship between deposition parameters (e.g., deposition time or gas flow rate ratio) and optical constants (e.g., refractive index and extinction coefficient) to extract the empirical formula for the optical constants with respect to film composition. To verify our simulation study, we fabricated a phase shifter based on our simulation result, which was found to have a transmittance of 8.3% and a phase shift of 179.5 degrees .

This characteristic makes the XX unique and, contrary to current two-stage designs, allows for the location of the secondary outside the evacuated tube. One of the XX concentrators presented achieves an average flux concentration within +/-0.73 deg of 91.1% of the thermodynamic limit with a collection efficiency of 96.8% (i.e., 3.2% of the rays incident on the primary mirror within +/-0.73 deg are rejected). Another XX design is 92.5% efficient and receives 95.1% of the maximum concentration. These values are the highest reported for practical concentrators, to our knowledge. The gap between the absorber and the secondary mirror is 6.8 and 10.5 times the absorber radius for each concentrator.

In the absence of quantization and transmission errors, the analysis and synthesis filters in a subband coding scheme can be designed to obtain perfect reconstruction of the input signal, but this is no longer the optimal solution in the presence of quantization of the subband coefficients. We presuppose the use of a two-dimensional (2-D) separable subband scheme and we address the problem of designing, for a given analysis filter bank and assuming uniform quantization of the subband coefficients, the set of row and column synthesis filters that minimize the mean squared reconstruction error at the output of the subband system. Since the corresponding optimization problem is inherently nonlinear, we propose a suboptimal solution that extends a one-dimensional (l-D) optimal filter design procedure, already presented in the literature, to a 2-D separable synthesis filter bank. The separable 2-D extension is not trivial, since the processing in one direction, e.g., the rows, alters the statistics of the signals for the design of the filters in the other direction, e.g., the columns. To further simplify the filter design, we propose to model the input image as a 2-D separable Markov process plus an additive white component. Several design examples using both synthetic signals and real world images are presented, showing that the filters designed using the proposed technique can give a significant gain with respect to the perfect reconstruction solution, especially when the dither technique is used for quantization. The simulation results also show that the proposed image model can be conveniently used in the synthesis filter design procedure."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"25","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18262988"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1057-7149","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Image Process","NlmUniqueID":"9886191","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/83.862626","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18262988","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

We start with a theoretical argument in favor of splines in the traditional formulation by showing that the optimal, curvature-constrained snake is a cubic spline, irrespective of the form of the external energy field. Unfortunately, such regularized snakes suffer from slow convergence speed because of a large number of control points, as well as from difficulties in determining the weight factors associated to the internal energies of the curve. We therefore propose an alternative formulation in which the intrinsic scale of the spline model is adjusted a priori; this leads to a reduction of the number of parameters to be optimized and eliminates the need for internal energies (i.e., the regularization term). In other words, we are now controlling the elasticity of the spline implicitly and rather intuitively by varying the spacing between the spline knots. The theory is embedded into a multiresolution formulation demonstrating improved stability in noisy image environments. Validation results are presented, comparing the traditional snake using internal energies and the proposed approach without internal energies, showing the similar performance of the latter. Several biomedical examples of applications are included to illustrate the versatility of the method."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"25","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18262987"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1057-7149","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Image Process","NlmUniqueID":"9886191","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/83.862624","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18262987","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The first method performs interpolation of text images using context-based, nonlinear, interpolative, vector quantization (NLIVQ). This system has a simple training procedure and has performance (for gray-level high resolution images) that is comparable to our more sophisticated generalized interpolative VQ (GIVQ) approach, which is the second method. In it, we jointly optimize the quantizer and interpolator to find matched codebooks for the low and high resolution images. Then, to obtain the binary codebook that incorporates binarization with interpolation, we introduce a binary constrained optimization method using GIVQ. In order to incorporate the nearest neighbor constraint on the quantizer while minimizing the distortion in the interpolated image, a deterministic-annealing-based optimization technique is applied. With a few interpolation examples, we demonstrate the superior performance of this method over the NLIVQ method (especially for binary outputs) and other standard techniques e.g., bilinear interpolation and pixel replication."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"15","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18262964"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1057-7149","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Image Process","NlmUniqueID":"9886191","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/83.847839","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18262964","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

An important instance of such a technique is the so-called pyramid decomposition scheme. This paper presents a general theory for constructing linear as well as nonlinear pyramid decomposition schemes for signal analysis and synthesis. The proposed theory is based on the following ingredients: 1) the pyramid consists of a (finite or infinite) number of levels such that the information content decreases toward higher levels and 2) each step toward a higher level is implemented by an (information-reducing) analysis operator, whereas each step toward a lower level is implemented by an (information-preserving) synthesis operator. One basic assumption is necessary: synthesis followed by analysis yields the identity operator, meaning that no information is lost by these two consecutive steps. Several examples of pyramid decomposition schemes are shown to be instances of the proposed theory: a particular class of linear pyramids, morphological skeleton decompositions, the morphological Haar pyramid, median pyramids, etc. Furthermore, the paper makes a distinction between single-scale and multiscale decomposition schemes, i.e., schemes without or with sample reduction.

In this setting, as well as in many other optimization tasks, functional substitution (FS) has been widely applied to simplify each step of the iterative process. The function to be minimized is replaced locally by an approximation having a more easily manipulated form, e.g., quadratic, but which maintains sufficient similarity to descend the true functional while computing only the substitute. We provide two new applications of FS methods in iterative coordinate descent for Bayesian tomography. The first is a modification of our coordinate descent algorithm with one-dimensional (1-D) Newton-Raphson approximations to an alternative quadratic which allows convergence to be proven easily. In simulations, we find essentially no difference in convergence speed between the two techniques. We also present a new algorithm which exploits the FS method to allow parallel updates of arbitrary sets of pixels using computations similar to iterative coordinate descent.

We present mathematical formulations for modeling object-based scalability and some functionalities that it brings with it. Our goal is to study algorithms that aid in semi-automating the authoring and subsequent selective addition/dropping of objects from a scene to provide content scalability. We start with a simplistic model for object-based scalability using the \"knapsack problem\"--a problem for which the optimal object set can be found using known schemes such as dynamic programming, the branch and bound method and approximation algorithms. The above formulation is then generalized to model authoring or multiplexing of scalable objects (e.g., objects encoded at various target bit-rates) using the \"multiple choice knapsack problem.\" We relate this model to several problems that arise in video coding, the most prominent of these being the bit allocation problem. Unlike previous approaches to solve the operational bit allocation problem using Lagrangean relaxation, we discuss an algorithm that solves linear programming (LP) relaxation of this problem. We show that for this problem the duality gap for Lagrange and LP relaxations is exactly the same. The LP relaxation is solved using strong duality with dual descent--a procedure that can be completed in \"linear\" time. We show that there can be at most two fractional variables in the optimal primal solution and therefore this relaxation can be justified for many practical applications. This work reduces problem complexity, guarantees similar performance, is slightly more generic, and provides an alternate LP-duality based proof for earlier work by Shoham and Gersho (1988). In addition, we show how additional constraints may be added to impose inter-dependencies among objects in a presentation and discuss how object aggregation can be exploited in reducing problem complexity. The marginal analysis approach of Fox (1966) is suggested as a method of re-allocation with incremental inputs. It helps in efficiently re-optimizing the allocation when a system has user interactivity, appearing or disappearing objects, time driven events, etc. Finally, we suggest that approximation algorithms for the multiple choice knapsack problem, which can be used to quantify complexity vs. quality tradeoff at the encoder in a tunable and universal way."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"11","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18262907"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1057-7149","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Image Process","NlmUniqueID":"9886191","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/83.869179","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18262907","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Since the rate policy emphasizes the stability of the state of the buffer, we can loose the advantage of variable bit rate coders, i.e., a (nearly) constant quality/distortion. To overcome the difficulty, the distortion policy is considered in this paper. Based on both the state of the buffer and the distortion, we can formulate the distortion policy. By choosing a proper weighting factor of the cost function in the distortion policy, the state of the buffer can be stable and/or the variation of the distortion sequence can be kept small. In addition, the properties of the distortion policy are obtained. We also consider switching and adaptive methods for the weighting factor to adjust time-varying characteristics of blocks of images. Using a JPEG-like image coder, the distortion policy is applied to buffer-constrained rate control."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"11","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18262897"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1057-7149","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Image Process","NlmUniqueID":"9886191","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/83.753741","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18262897","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Packetized video is likely to be one of the most significant high-bandwidth users of such networks. The transmission of variable bit-rate (VBR) video offers the potential promise of constant video quality but is generally accompanied by packet loss which significantly diminishes this potential. We study a class of error recovery schemes employing forward error-control (FEC) coding to recover from such losses. In particular, we show that a hybrid error recovery strategy involving the use of active FEC in tandem with simple passive error concealment schemes offers very robust performance even under high packet losses. We discuss two different methods of applying FEC to alleviate the problem of packet loss. The conventional method of applying FEC generally allocates additional bandwidth for channel coding while maintaining a specified average video coding rate. Such an approach suffers performance degradations at high loads since the bandwidth expansion associated with the use of FEC creates additional congestion that negates the potential benefit in using FEC. In contrast, we study a more efficient FEC application technique in our hybrid approach, which allocates bandwidth for channel coding by throttling the source coder rate (i.e., performing higher compression) while maintaining a fixed overall transmission rate. More specifically, we consider the performance of the hybrid approach where the bandwidth to accommodate the FEC overhead is made available by throttling the source coder rate sufficiently so that the overall rate after application of FEC is identical to that of the original unprotected system. We obtain the operational rate-distortion characteristics of such a scheme employing selected FEC codes. In doing so, we demonstrate the robust performance achieved by appropriate use of FEC under moderate-to-high packet losses in comparison to the unprotected system."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"28","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18262879"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1057-7149","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Image Process","NlmUniqueID":"9886191","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/83.748891","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18262879","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"12","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

It is this synapse dynamical system that makes the TSP constraint hold at any final states for whatever choices of the IIM parameters and an initial state.

First, for the data belonging to a class we define a fuzzy rule with an ellipsoidal region. Namely, using the training data for each class, we calculate the center and the covariance matrix of the ellipsoidal region for the class. Then we tune the fuzzy rules, i.e., the slopes of the membership functions, successively until there is no improvement in the recognition rate of the training data. Then if the number of the data belonging to a class that are misclassified into another class exceeds a prescribed number, we define a new cluster to which those data belong and the associated fuzzy rule. Then we tune the newly defined fuzzy rules in the similar way as stated above, fixing the already obtained fuzzy rules. We iterate generation of clusters and tuning of the newly generated fuzzy rules until the number of the data belonging to a class that are misclassified into another class does not exceed the prescribed number. We evaluate our method using thyroid data, Japanese Hiragana data of vehicle license plates, and blood cell data. By dynamic cluster generation, the generalization ability of the classifier is improved and the recognition rate of the fuzzy classifier for the test data is the best among the neural network classifiers and other fuzzy classifiers if there are no discrete input variables."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18256006"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1083-4419","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern B Cybern","NlmUniqueID":"9890044","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/3477.735397","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18256006","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The qualitative state of a system is represented by the marking of the net. The crossing of a landmark value corresponds to the firing of a transition. We give a formal procedure to construct a Petri net model corresponding to a given set of qualitative equations. The approach can be used to study both autonomous systems and systems with forcing inputs. The dynamic behavior of the system can be studied as sequences of reachable markings of the net and can be computed with standard Petri net execution techniques.

Then, it presents the proposed algorithm with its two major components: the convex-elastic net (CEN) algorithm and the nondeterministic iterative improvement (NII) algorithm. These two algorithms are combined into the efficient convex-elastic net (ECEN) algorithm. The CEN algorithm integrates the convex-hull property and elastic net algorithm to generate an initial tour for the E-TSP. The NII algorithm uses two rearrangement operators to improve the initial tour given by the CEN algorithm. The paper presents simulation results for two instances of E-TSP: randomly generated tours and tours for well-known problems in the literature. Experimental results are given to show that the proposed algorithm ran find the nearly optimal solution for the E-TSP that outperform many similar algorithms reported in the literature.

Our approach is based on the alternate execution of two fundamental processes: map building and navigation. In the former, range measures are collected through the robot exteroceptive sensors and processed in order to build a local representation of the surrounding area. This representation is then integrated in the global map so far reconstructed by filtering out insufficient or conflicting information. In the navigation phase, an A*-based planner generates a local path from the current robot position to the goal. Such a path is safe inside the explored area and provides a direction for further exploration. The robot follows the path up to the boundary of the explored area, terminating its motion if unexpected obstacles are encountered. The most peculiar aspects of our method are the use of fuzzy logic for the efficient building and modification of the environment map, and the iterative application of A*, a complete planning algorithm which takes full advantage of local information. Experimental results for a NOMAD 200 mobile robot show the real-time performance of the proposed method, both in static and moderately dynamic environments."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18255950"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1083-4419","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern B Cybern","NlmUniqueID":"9890044","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/3477.678626","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18255950","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Since this binocular head is composed of off-the-shelf components, its kinematic parameters are unknown. Therefore, we can not directly apply those existing nonlinear optimization methods. Even if we want to use the nonlinear optimization methods, a closed-form solution can be first applied to obtain accurate enough initial values. Hence, this paper considers only methods that provide closed-form solutions, i.e., those requiring no initial estimates. Notice that most existing closed-form solutions require pose (i.e., both position and orientation) measurements. However, as far as we know, there is no inexpensive technique which can provide accurate pose measurements. Therefore, existing closed-form solutions based on pose measurements can not give us the required accuracy. As a result, we have developed a new method that does not require orientation measurements and can use only the position measurements of a calibration point to obtain highly accurate estimates of kinematic parameters using closed-form solutions. The proposed method is based on the complete and parametrically continuous (CPC) kinematic model, and can be applied to any kind of kinematic parameter identification problems with or without multiple end-effecters, providing that the links are rigid, the joints are either revolute or prismatic and no closed-loop kinematic chain is included."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18255944"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1083-4419","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern B Cybern","NlmUniqueID":"9890044","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/3477.662767","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18255944","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The ADT taxonomy for categorizing such techniques was proposed in 1995 to provide a basis for the systematic comparison of the different approaches. This paper shows that not only is this taxonomy applicable to a cross section of current techniques for extracting rules from trained feedforward ANN's but also how the taxonomy can be adapted and extended to embrace a broader range of ANN types (e.g., recurrent neural networks) and explanation structures. In addition the paper identifies some of the key research questions in extracting the knowledge embedded within ANN's including the need for the formulation of a consistent theoretical basis for what has been, until recently, a disparate collection of empirical results."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"09","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18255792"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1045-9227","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Neural Netw","NlmUniqueID":"101211035","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/72.728352","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18255792","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

On the other hand, most connectionist models assume that data are organized according to relatively poor structures, like arrays or sequences. The framework described in this paper is an attempt to unify adaptive models like artificial neural nets and belief nets for the problem of processing structured information. In particular, relations between data variables are expressed by directed acyclic graphs, where both numerical and categorical values coexist. The general framework proposed in this paper can be regarded as an extension of both recurrent neural networks and hidden Markov models to the case of acyclic graphs. In particular we study the supervised learning problem as the problem of learning transductions from an input structured space to an output structured space, where transductions are assumed to admit a recursive hidden statespace representation. We introduce a graphical formalism for representing this class of adaptive transductions by means of recursive networks, i.e., cyclic graphs where nodes are labeled by variables and edges are labeled by generalized delay elements. This representation makes it possible to incorporate the symbolic and subsymbolic nature of data. Structures are processed by unfolding the recursive network into an acyclic graph called encoding network. In so doing, inference and learning algorithms can be easily inherited from the corresponding algorithms for artificial neural networks or probabilistic graphical model."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"09","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18255765"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1045-9227","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Neural Netw","NlmUniqueID":"101211035","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/72.712151","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18255765","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Voting is performed for assigning a score to both global and local features. The score represents the evidential support provided by input data for the presence of a feature. Clustering aims at individuating a minimal set of significant local features by grouping together simpler correlated observations. It is based on a spatial relation between simple observations on a fixed level, i.e., the definition of a distance in an appropriate space. As the multilevel structure of the system implies that input data for an intermediate level are outputs of the lower level, voting can be seen as a functional representation of the \"part-of\" relation between features at different abstraction levels.

For flexibility purposes, the original image is not necessary during the ownership verification process, so it must be modeled by noise. Two tests are involved in the ownership verification stage: watermark decoding, in which the message carried by the watermark is extracted, and watermark detection, which decides whether a given image contains a watermark generated with a certain key. We apply generalized Gaussian distributions to statistically model the DCT coefficients of the original image and show how the resulting detector structures lead to considerable improvements in performance with respect to the correlation receiver, which has been widely considered in the literature and makes use of the Gaussian noise assumption.

Of particular importance in the design of the experiment was the fact that no features beyond the piece differential were given to the neural networks as a priori knowledge. The process of evolution was able to extract all of the additional information required to play at this level of competency.

Hence, any method for learning from finite samples needs to have some provisions for complexity control. Existing implementations of complexity control include penalization (or regularization), weight decay (in neural networks), and various greedy procedures (aka constructive, growing, or pruning methods). There are numerous proposals for determining optimal model complexity (aka model selection) based on various (asymptotic) analytic estimates of the prediction risk and on resampling approaches. Nonasymptotic bounds on the prediction risk based on Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC)-theory have been proposed by Vapnik. This paper describes application of VC-bounds to regression problems with the usual squared loss. An empirical study is performed for settings where the VC-bounds can be rigorously applied, i.e., linear models and penalized linear models where the VC-dimension can be accurately estimated, and the empirical risk can be reliably minimized. Empirical comparisons between model selection using VC-bounds and classical methods are performed for various noise levels, sample size, target functions and types of approximating functions. Our results demonstrate the advantages of VC-based complexity control with finite samples."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"10","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18252610"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1045-9227","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Neural Netw","NlmUniqueID":"101211035","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/72.788648","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18252610","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The TDGAR learning scheme is a new hybrid GA, which integrates the TD prediction method and the GA to fulfill the reinforcement learning task. Structurely, the TDGAR learning system is composed of two integrated feedforward networks. One neural network acts as a critic network for helping the learning of the other network, the action network, which determines the outputs (actions) of the TDGAR learning system. Using the TD prediction method, the critic network can predict the external reinforcement signal and provide a more informative internal reinforcement signal to the action network. The action network uses the GA to adapt itself according to the internal reinforcement signal. This can usually accelerate the GA learning since an external reinforcement signal may only be available at a time long after a sequence of actions have occurred in the reinforcement learning problems. By defining a simple external reinforcement signal, the TDGAR learning system can learn to produce a series of small perturbations to convert chaotic oscillations of a chaotic system into desired regular ones with a periodic behavior. The proposed method is an adaptive search for the optimum control technique.

The RSONFIN is inherently a recurrent multilayered connectionist network for realizing the basic elements and functions of dynamic fuzzy inference, and may be considered to be constructed from a series of dynamic fuzzy rules. The temporal relations embedded in the network are built by adding some feedback connections representing the memory elements to a feedforward neural fuzzy network. Each weight as well as node in the RSONFIN has its own meaning and represents a special element in a fuzzy rule. There are no hidden nodes (i.e., no membership functions and fuzzy rules) initially in the RSONFIN. They are created on-line via concurrent structure identification (the construction of dynamic fuzzy if-then rules) and parameter identification (the tuning of the free parameters of membership functions). The structure learning together with the parameter learning forms a fast learning algorithm for building a small, yet powerful, dynamic neural fuzzy network. Two major characteristics of the RSONFIN can thus be seen: 1) the recurrent property of the RSONFIN makes it suitable for dealing with temporal problems and 2) no predetermination, like the number of hidden nodes, must be given, since the RSONFIN can find its optimal structure and parameters automatically and quickly. Moreover, to reduce the number of fuzzy rules generated, a flexible input partition method, the aligned clustering-based algorithm, is proposed. Various simulations on temporal problems are done and performance comparisons with some existing recurrent networks are also made.

We show here, however, that a huge class of biophysically detailed and biologically plausible neural-network models can be transformed into a canonical pulse-coupled form by a piece-wise continuous, possibly noninvertible, change of variables. Such transformations exist when a network satisfies a number of conditions; e.g., it is weakly connected; the neurons are Class 1 excitable (i.e., they can generate action potentials with an arbitrary small frequency); and the synapses between neurons are conventional (i.e., axo-dendritic and axo-somatic). Thus, the difference between studying the pulse-coupled model and Hodgkin-Huxley-type neural networks is just a matter of a coordinate change. Therefore, any piece of information about the pulse-coupled model is valuable since it tells something about all weakly connected networks of Class 1 neurons. For example, we show that the pulse-coupled network of identical neurons does not synchronize in-phase. This confirms Ermentrout's result that weakly connected Class 1 neurons are difficult to synchronize, regardless of the equations that describe dynamics of each cell."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"10","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18252548"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1045-9227","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Neural Netw","NlmUniqueID":"101211035","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/72.761707","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18252548","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The new CRBP algorithm includes as particular cases backpropagation (BP), temporal backpropagation (TBP), backpropagation for sequences (BPS), Back-Tsoi algorithm among others, thereby providing a unifying view on gradient calculation techniques for recurrent networks with local feedback. The only learning method that has been proposed for locally recurrent networks with no architectural restriction is the one by Back and Tsoi. The proposed algorithm has better stability and higher speed of convergence with respect to the Back-Tsoi algorithm, which is supported by the theoretical development and confirmed by simulations. The computational complexity of the CRBP is comparable with that of the Back-Tsoi algorithm, e.g., less that a factor of 1.5 for usual architectures and parameter settings. The superior performance of the new algorithm, however, easily justifies this small increase in computational burden. In addition, the general paradigms of truncated BPTT and RTRL are applied to networks with local feedback and compared with the new CRBP method. The simulations show that CRBP exhibits similar performances and the detailed analysis of complexity reveals that CRBP is much simpler and easier to implement, e.g., CRBP is local in space and in time while RTRL is not local in space."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"09","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18252525"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1045-9227","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Neural Netw","NlmUniqueID":"101211035","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/72.750549","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18252525","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Beside the original neocognitron a modification of the neocognitron is proposed which combines neurons from perceptron with the localized network structure of neocognitron. Instead of training convolutional networks by time-consuming error backpropagation, in this work a modular procedure is applied whereby layers are trained sequentially from the input to the output layer in order to recognize features of increasing complexity. For a quantitative experimental comparison with standard classifiers two very different recognition tasks have been chosen: handwritten digit recognition and face recognition. In the first example on handwritten digit recognition the generalization of convolutional networks is compared to fully connected networks. In several experiments the influence of variations of position, size, and orientation of digits is determined and the relation between training sample size and validation error is observed.

In all experiments, the maximum penalized likelihood approach and averaging improved performance considerably if compared to a maximum likelihood approach. In two of the experiments, the maximum penalized likelihood approach outperformed averaging. In one experiment averaging was clearly superior. Our conclusion is that maximum penalized likelihood gives good results if the penalty term in the cost function is appropriate for the particular problem. If this is not the case, averaging is superior since it shows greater robustness by not relying on any particular prior assumption.

This has two serious effects on the performance of the method. First, it can result in an inefficient storage of data which can increase recognition time. Second, given that geometric hashing is highly amenable to parallel implementation, a nonuniform distribution of data poses difficulties in tackling the load-balancing problem. Finding a \"good\" geometric hash function which redistributes the invariants uniformly over the hash space is not easy. Current approaches make assumptions about the statistical characteristics of the data and then use techniques from probability theory to calculate a transformation that maps the nonuniform distribution of invariants to a uniform one. In this paper, a new approach is proposed based on an elastic hash table. In contrast to existing approaches which try to redistribute the invariants over the hash bins, we proceed oppositely by distributing the hash bins over the invariants. The key idea is to associate the hash bins with the output nodes of a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) neural network which is trained using the invariants as training examples. In this way, the location of a hash bin in the space of invariants is determined by the weight vector of the node associated with the hash bin. During training, the SOFM spreads the hash bins proportionally to the distribution of invariants (i.e., more hash bins are assigned to higher density areas while less hash bins are assigned to lower density areas) and adjusts their size so that they eventually hold almost the same number of invariants. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it is a process that adapts to the invariants through learning. Hence, it makes absolutely no assumptions about the statistical characteristics of the invariants and the geometric hash function is actually computed through learning. Furthermore, SOFM's \"topology preserving\" property ensures that the computed geometric hash function should be well behaved. The proposed approach, was shown to perform well on both artificial and real data."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"02","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18252479"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1045-9227","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Neural Netw","NlmUniqueID":"101211035","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/72.668897","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18252479","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Our objective is to resolve the difficulty associated with the persistency of excitation condition inherent to the standard schemes in the neural identification literature. This difficulty is circumvented here by a novel formulation and by using a new class of identification algorithms recently obtained by Didinsky et al. We show how these algorithms can be exploited to successfully identify the nonlinearity in the system using neural-network models. By embedding the original problem in one with noise-perturbed state measurements, we present a class of identifiers (under L1 and L2 cost criteria) which secure a good approximant for the system nonlinearity provided that some global optimization technique is used. In this respect, many available learning algorithms in the current neural-network literature, e.g., the backpropagation scheme and the genetic algorithms-based scheme, with slight modifications, can ensure the identification of the system nonlinearity. Subsequently, we address the same problem under a third, worst case L(infinity) criterion for an RBF modeling. We present a neural-network version of an H(infinity)-based identification algorithm from Didinsky et al and show how, along with an appropriate choice of control input to enhance excitation, under both full-state-derivative information (FSDI) and noise-perturbed full-state-information (NPFSI), it leads to satisfaction of a relevant persistency of excitation condition, and thereby to robust identification of the nonlinearity. Results from several simulation studies have been included to demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"02","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18252465"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1045-9227","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Neural Netw","NlmUniqueID":"101211035","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/72.668883","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18252465","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

If these phases are heterogeneous toward each other, the total learning algorithm shows a variety of extraordinary abilities; especially in regards to multimedia information processing. In the first phase of descent cost learning, elements of source data are grouped. Simultaneously, a weight vector for minimal learning, (i.e., a winner), is found. Then, the winner and its partners are updated for further cost reduction. Therefore, two classes of self-organizing feature maps are generated. One is called a grouping feature map, which partitions the source data. The other is an ordinary weight vector feature map. The grouping feature map, together with the winners, retains most of the source data information. This feature map is able to assist in a high quality approximation of the original data. Traditional weight vector feature maps lack this ability. Another important capacity of the grouping feature map is that it can change its shape. Thus, the grouping pattern can accept external directions in order to metamorphose. In the text, the total algorithm of the multiple descent cost competition is explained first. In that section, image processing concepts are introduced in order to assist in the description of this algorithm. Then, a still image is first data-compressed (DC). Next, a restored image is morphed using the grouping feature map by receiving directions given by an external intelligence. Next, an interpolation of frames is applied in order to complete animation coding (AC). Thus, multiple descent cost competition bridges \"DC to AC.\" Examples of multimedia processing on virtual digital movies are given."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"20","Month":"05","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18252433"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1045-9227","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Neural Netw","NlmUniqueID":"101211035","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/72.655033","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18252433","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

A four-step approach to build a fuzzy system automatically is presented: Step 1 directly obtains the optimum fuzzy rules for a given membership function configuration. Step 2 optimizes the allocation of the membership functions and the conclusion of the rules, in order to achieve a better approximation. Step 3 determines a new and more suitable topology with the information derived from the approximation error distribution; it decides which variables should increase the number of membership functions. Finally, Step 4 determines which structure should be selected to approximate the function, from the possible configurations provided by the algorithm in the three previous steps.

Many research papers on improving the performance of these techniques have been published; many directions are proposed, which can all lead to better performance than the conventional techniques. Among them, both generalized block-matching and variable-size block-matching are successfully applied in reducing the data rate of compensation error and motion information, respectively. These two algorithms have their merits, but suffer from their drawbacks. Moreover, reducing the data rate in compensation error is sometimes increasing the data rate in motion information, or vice versa. Based on these two algorithms, we propose and examine several algorithms which are effective in reducing the data rate. We then incorporate these algorithms into a system, in which they work together to overcome the disadvantages to individual and keep their merits at the same time. The proposed system can optimally balance the amount of data rate in two aspects (i.e., compensation error and motion information).

CAN approach distinguishes itself from other approaches by being direct, meaning that there are no intermediate representations, an induced rule is never altered in later stages and only tests that appear in the final solution are generated. In the selection of rule conditions (tests) existing rule induction algorithms do not provide a satisfactory answer to the partitioning of the feature space of discrete feature variables with nonordered qualitative values (i.e., categorical attributes) for multiclass problems. Existing algorithms have exponential complexity in N, where N is the number of feature values. Therefore, heuristic algorithms are employed at this step.

Unfortunately, relatively few well-structured methodologies exist for designing and, in many cases, human experts are not able to express the knowledge needed to solve the problem in the form of fuzzy rules. Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy rule-based systems were enunciated in order to solve this design problem because they are usually identified using numerical data. In this paper we present a two-stage evolutionary process for designing TSK fuzzy rule-based systems from examples combining a generation stage based on a (mu, lambda)-evolution strategy, in which the fuzzy rules with different consequents compete among themselves to form part of a preliminary knowledge base, and a refinement stage in which both the antecedent and consequent parts of the fuzzy rules in this previous knowledge base are adapted by a hybrid evolutionary process composed of a genetic algorithm and an evolution strategy to obtain the final Knowledge base whose rules cooperate in the best possible way. Some aspects make this process different from others proposed until now: the design problem is addressed in two different stages, the use of an angular coding of the consequent parameters that allows us to search across the whole space of possible solutions, and the use of the available knowledge about the system under identification to generate the initial populations of the Evolutionary Algorithms that causes the search process to obtain good solutions more quickly. The performance of the method proposed is shown by solving two different problems: the fuzzy modeling of some three-dimensional surfaces and the computing of the maintenance costs of electrical medium line in Spanish towns. Results obtained are compared with other kind of techniques, evolutionary learning processes to design TSK and Mamdani-type fuzzy rule-based systems in the first case, and classical regression and neural modeling in the second."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18252351"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1083-4419","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern B Cybern","NlmUniqueID":"9890044","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/3477.809026","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18252351","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"7","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

This important feature is embedded into a Hopfield neural network to derive a new technique, i.e., mean field annealing. This work applies the Hopfield neural network and the normalized mean field annealing technique, respectively, to resolve a multiprocessor problem (known to be a NP-hard problem) with no process migration, constrained times (execution time and deadline) and limited resources.

In this correspondence, we present a neural network approach to the motion determination problem without any calibration. Two kinds of sensory data, namely, camera images and laser range data, are used as the input to a multilayer feedforward network to associate the direct transformation from the sensory data to the required motions. This provides a practical sensor fusion method. Using a recursive motion strategy and in terms of a network correction, we relax the requirement for the exactness of the learned transformation.

This is a generalization of the classical problem of finding the maximum cardinality clique of an unweighted graph, which arises as a special case of the MWCP when all the weights associated to the vertices are equal. The problem is known to be NP-hard for arbitrary graphs and, according to recent theoretical results, so is the problem of approximating it within a constant factor. Although there has recently been much interest around neural-network algorithms for the unweighted maximum clique problem, no effort has been directed so far toward its weighted counterpart. In this paper, we present a parallel, distributed heuristic for approximating the MWCP based on dynamics principles developed and studied in various branches of mathematical biology. The proposed framework centers around a recently introduced continuous characterization of the MWCP which generalizes an earlier remarkable result by Motzkin and Straus. This allows us to formulate the MWCP (a purely combinatorial problem) in terms of a continuous quadratic programming problem. One drawback associated with this formulation, however, is the presence of \"spurious\" solutions, and we present characterizations of these solutions. To avoid them we introduce a new regularized continuous formulation of the MWCP inspired by previous works on the unweighted problem, and show how this approach completely solves the problem. The continuous formulation of the MWCP naturally maps onto a parallel, distributed computational network whose dynamical behavior is governed by the so-called replicator equations. These are dynamical systems introduced in evolutionary game theory and population genetics to model evolutionary processes on a macroscopic scale.We present theoretical results which guarantee that the solutions provided by our clique finding replicator network are actually the ones being sought. Extensive experiments on both randomly generated and standard benchmark graphs have been conducted, and the results obtained confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"28","Month":"06","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18249849"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1045-9227","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Neural Netw","NlmUniqueID":"101211035","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/72.883403","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18249849","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"6","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"6","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"6","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Topology and distance preserving mapping techniques--e.g., Kohonen's self-organizing feature map (SOM) or Sammon's nonlinear mapping (NLM)--are available to achieve multivariate data projections for the following interactive visual analysis process. For large data bases, however, NLM computation becomes intractable. Also, if additional data points or data sets are to be included in the projection, a complete recomputation of the mapping is required. In general, a neural network could learn the mapping and serve for arbitrary additional data projection. However, the computational costs would also be high, and convergence is not easily achieved. In this work, a convenient hierarchical neural projection approach is introduced, where first an unsupervised neural network--e.g., an SOM--quantizes the data base, followed by fast NLM mapping of the quantized data. In the second stage of the hierarchy, an enhancement of the NLM by a recall algorithm is applied. The training and application of a second neural network, which is learning the mapping by function approximation, is quantitatively compared with this new approach.

Bayesian networks (BN's) are versatile tools that possess this inference capability. However, BN's require explicit specification of conditional independencies, which may be difficult to assess given limited data. Alternatively, Cheeseman proposed finding the maximum entropy (ME) joint probability mass function (pmf) consistent with arbitrary lower order probability constraints. This approach is in principle powerful and does not require explicit expression of conditional independence. However, until now, the huge learning complexity has severely limited the use of this approach. Here we propose an approximate ME method, which also encodes arbitrary low-order constraints but while retaining quite tractable learning. Our method uses a restriction of joint pmf support (during learning) to a subset of the feature space.

The genetic algorithm (GA) adopted in this paper is based upon symbiotic evolution which, when applied to fuzzy controller design, complements the local mapping property of a fuzzy rule. Using this Symbiotic-Evolution-based Fuzzy Controller (SEFC) design method, the number of control trials, as well as consumed CPU time, are considerably reduced when compared to traditional GA-based fuzzy controller design methods and other types of genetic reinforcement learning schemes. Moreover, unlike traditional fuzzy controllers, which partition the input space into a grid, SEFC partitions the input space in a flexible way, thus creating fewer fuzzy rules. In SEFC, different types of fuzzy rules whose consequent parts are singletons, fuzzy sets, or linear equations (TSK-type fuzzy rules) are allowed. Further, the free parameters (e.g., centers and widths of membership functions) and fuzzy rules are all tuned automatically. For the TSK-type fuzzy rule especially, which put the proposed learning algorithm in use, only the significant input variables are selected to participate in the consequent of a rule. The proposed SEFC design method has been applied to different simulated control problems, including the cart-pole balancing system, a magnetic levitation system, and a water bath temperature control system. The proposed SEFC has been verified to be efficient and superior from these control problems, and from comparisons with some traditional GA-based fuzzy systems."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18244755"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1083-4419","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern B Cybern","NlmUniqueID":"9890044","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/3477.836377","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18244755","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The term real-world refers to systems under computer control that relate to everyday life and are beneficial to the society in the large. The traditional approach to such problems consists of designing a central entity which collects all data, executes a decision-making algorithm sequentially to yield the decisions, and propagates the decisions to the respective sites. Centralized decision-making algorithms are slow and highly vulnerable to natural and artificial catastrophes. Recent literature includes successful asynchronous, distributed, decision-making algorithm designs wherein the local decision making at every site replaces the centralized decision making to achieve faster response, higher reliability, and greater accuracy of the decisions. Two key issues include (1) the lack of an approach to synthesize asynchronous, distributed, decision-making algorithms, for any given problem, and (2) the absence of a comparative analysis of the quality of their decisions. This paper proposes MFAD, a Mathematical Framework for Asynchronous, Distributed Systems, that permits the description of centralized decision-making algorithms and facilities the synthesis of distributed decision-making algorithms.

Because of its geometrical features, the ultrasound beam angles of a curved PVDF transducer can be unsymmetrical (i.e., broad horizontally and narrow vertically). This feature is desired in some applications. In this work, a curved PVDF air transducer is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Two resonances were observed in this transducer. They are length extensional mode and flexural bending mode. Surface vibration profiles of these two modes were measured by a laser vibrometer. It was found from the experiment that the surface vibration was not uniform along the curvature direction for both vibration modes. Theoretical calculations based on a model developed in this work confirmed the experimental results. Two displacement peaks were found in the piezoelectric active direction of PVDF film for the length extensional mode; three peaks were found for the flexural bending mode. The observed peak positions were in good agreement with the calculation results. Transient surface displacement measurements revealed that vibration peaks were in phase for the length extensional mode and out of phase for the flexural bending mode. Therefore, the length extensional mode can generate a stronger ultrasound wave than the flexural bending mode. The resonance frequencies and vibration amplitudes of the two modes strongly depend on the structure parameters as well as the material properties.

The approach obtains the SIR by applying coordinate transform and then superposing the SIRs of a row of narrow strips into which the aperture is divided in one direction (in which the aperture is curved). The strips are so narrow that they can be considered planar, rectangular apertures whose exact SIRs are available in analytic form. In a special case where the field points are on the center axis of the cylindrical curve, the analytic form of the SIR of the curved, rectangular aperture is found. The SIR of a linear array with a cylindrically concave surface is then obtained using the approach. The pulsed-echo fields from the array (i.e., those radiated by the array, diffracted by a point-like scatterer, and received by the same array) are further simulated and have been measured using a point-like scatterer.

The accuracy of the estimation formula was tested by comparing it with the spectral widths found by using conventional spectral estimation on simulated Doppler signals from pulsatile flow. The influence of acceleration, sample volume size, and time window duration on the Doppler spectral width was investigated for flow with blunt and parabolic velocity profiles passing through Gaussian-shaped sample volumes. Our results show that, for short duration windows, the spectral width is dominated by window broadening and that acceleration has a small effect on the spectral width. For long duration windows, the effect of acceleration must be taken into account. The size of the sample volume affects the spectral width of the Doppler signal in two ways: by intrinsic broadening and by the range of velocities passing through it. These effects act in opposite directions. The simple spectral width estimation formula was shown to have excellent agreement with widths calculated using the model and indicates the potential for correcting not only for window and nonstationarity broadening but also for intrinsic broadening."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18244314"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0885-3010","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","NlmUniqueID":"9882735","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/58.796126","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18244314","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The decisive advantage of these SAW transponders lies in their passive operation (i.e., no power-supply), and in the possibility of wireless installation at particularly inaccessible locations. The passive SAW transponders are maintenance free. Identification marks respond to an interrogation signal with their nonchanging identification pattern. In wireless SAW sensors the physical or chemical properties to be detected change the propagation characteristics of the SAW. SAW radio transponders are advantageously placed on moving or rotating parts and in hazardous environments such as contaminated or high voltage areas. They also can be used for contactless measurements in high vacuum process chambers, under concrete, extreme heat, or strong radioactive radiation, where the use of conventional sensors is complicated, dangerous, or expensive.

In this paper we apply these results to develop an unsupervised segmentation scheme that partitions an RF A-scan or B-scan image into statistically homogeneous regions that reflect the underlying scattering characteristics. The proposed segmentation scheme is based on a nonparametric homogeneity test that compares two regions of interest (ROI) for possible merging utilizing information about both the coherent and the diffuse component of the RF echo. For the coherent component, homogeneity is defined in terms of the estimated average spacing of each ROI. For the diffuse component, we use the nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) homogeneity statistical test that compares two empirical distributions associated with any two ROIs. This test can be used to obtain a segmentation into regions with different scattering characteristics regardless of the nature of the scattering conditions (e.g., Rayleigh regions with different scatterer concentration, different non-Rayleigh regions, or different coherent scattering regions). Finer segmentation can be obtained by learning the distributions associated with the various homogeneous regions obtained from the coarse segmenter. The proposed segmentation scheme is applied on simulated RF scans with different scatterer concentration per resolution cell, on phantom data which mimic tissue, and on liver scans. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the segmentation algorithm even in cases of subtle differences in the scattering characteristics of each region (for example, diffuse component with scatterer density of 16 and 32 scatterers per resolution cell)."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18244229"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0885-3010","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","NlmUniqueID":"9882735","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/58.677728","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18244229","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

It is compared with the conical transducer, which also gives an approximate limited-diffraction solution to the wave equation. The conical transducer's field deviates from the predicted field in the nearfield, where it is wider. Therefore, the Bessel beam is better for use in a hybrid system where a limited-diffraction beam is used for transmission and a dynamically focused beam for reception. The limited-diffraction Bessel beam of order zero can be excited on an annular transducer with equal-area division of elements and with a fixed prefocus, i.e., conventional transducers used in commercial medical imaging equipment. The element division implies that the scaling parameter must be chosen to contain the first lobe of the Bessel function in the first element. In addition, the prefocus must be such that the array is steerable to infinite depth with minor loss. Even when the Bessel beam yields a larger depth of field than that of an unfocused transducer, it has the advantage of a narrower beam.

The system is designed to-operate in the bandwidth 1.2 to 1.8 MHz, with independent channel power control up to 60 W (8 bit resolution) for each array element. To reduce power variation between elements, the system utilizes switching regulators in a feedback loop to automatically adjust the DC supply of a class D/E power converter. This feedback reduces the RF electrical power variation from 20% to 1% into a 16 element array. DC-to-RF efficiencies close to 70% for all power levels eliminates the need for large heat sinks. In addition to power control, each channel may be phase shifted 360 degrees with a minimum of 8 bit resolution. To ensure proper operation while driving ultrasound arrays with varying element sizes, each RF driving channel implements phase feedback such that proper phase of the driving signal is produced either at the amplifier output before the matching circuitry or after the matching circuitry at the transducer face. This feedback has been experimentally shown to increase the focal intensities by 20 to 25% of two tested phased arrays without array calibration using a hydrophone."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18244194"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0885-3010","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","NlmUniqueID":"9882735","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/58.660153","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18244194","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

In particular, degeneracies having Poincare indexes with opposite signs may merge and \"annihilate\".

Such a measure was previously formulated for systems employing cross-correlation based time-delay estimators through the strain filter. While the strain filter predicts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR(e)) for each tissue strain in the elastogram and provides valuable insights into the nature of image noise, it understated the effects of image resolution (axial resolution, as determined by the cross-correlation window length) on the noise. In this work, the strain filter is modified to study the strain noise at multiple resolutions. The effects of finite window length on signal decorrelation and on the variance of the strain estimator are investigated. Long-duration windows are preferred for improved sensitivity, dynamic range, and SNR(e). However, in this limit the elastogram is degraded due to poor resolution. The results indicate that for nonzero strain, a window length exists at which the variance of strain estimator attains its minima, and consequently the elastographic sensitivity, dynamic range and SNR(e) are strongly affected by the selected window length. Simulation results corroborate the theoretical results, illustrating the presence of a window length where the strain estimation variance is minimized for a given strain value. Multiresolution elastography, where the strain estimate with the highest SNR(e) obtained by processing the pre- and post-compression waveforms at different window lengths is used to generate a composite elastogram and is proposed to improve elastograms. All the objective elastogram parameters (namely: SNR(e), dynamic range, sensitivity and the average elastographic resolution-defined as the cross-correlation window length) are improved with multiresolution elastography when compared to the traditional method of utilizing a single window length to generate the elastogram. Experimental results using a phantom with a hard inclusion illustrates the improvement in elastogram obtained using multiresolution analysis."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18244159"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0885-3010","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","NlmUniqueID":"9882735","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/58.646912","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18244159","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"5","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The purpose of this paper is to review and present new insight into seven important considerations for the design of active piezoelectric polymer ultrasound transducers: piezoelectric polymer materials selection, transducer construction and packaging requirements, materials characterization and modeling, film thickness and active area design, electroding selection, backing material design, and front protection/matching layer design. Besides reviewing these design considerations, this paper also presents new insight into the design of active piezoelectric polymer ultrasonic transducers. The design and fabrication of an immersible ultrasonic transducer, which has no adhesive layer between the active element and backing layer, is included. The transducer features direct deposition of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] copolymer onto an insulated aluminum backing substrate. Pulse-echo tests indicated a minimum insertion loss of 37 dB and -6 dB bandwidth of 9.8 to 22 MHz (71%). The use of polymer wear-protection/quarter-wave matching layers is also discussed. Test results on a P(VDF-TrFE) transducer showed that a Mylar/sup TM/ front layer provided a slight increase in pulse-echo amplitude of 15% (or 1.2 dB) and an increase in -6 dB pulse-echo fractional bandwidth from 86 to 95%. Theoretical derivations are reported for optimizing the active area of the piezoelectric polymer element for maximum power transfer at resonance. These derivations are extended to the special case for a low profile (i.e., thin) shielded transducer.

In this paper, we propose a new reflector-filter structure using a SAW waveguide directional coupler. For the implementation of the proposed reflector-filter, the key technology is the design of SAW waveguides. We have formed SAW waveguides using Al gratings loaded on the surface of the substrate. The pitch of the Al gratings has been chosen unequal to half the acoustical wavelength to avoid the occurrence of the gratings stopband at the filters passband position.

The objective of this research is the development of catheter-based mechanical sector scanners incorporating high frequency ultrasound transducers operating at frequencies up to 20 MHz. The authors' current transducer assembly consists of a single 1.75 mm by 1.75 mm, 20 MHz, PZT element mounted on a 2 mm by 2 mm square, 75 mum thick polyimide table that pivots on 3-mum thick gold plated polyimide hinges. The hinges also serve as the electrical connections to the transducer. This table-mounted transducer is tilted using a miniature linear actuator to produce a sector scan. This linear actuator is an integrated force array (IFA), which is an example of a micromachine, i.e., a microelectromechanical system (MEMS). The IFA is a thin (2.2 mum) polyimide membrane, which consists of a network of hundreds of thousands of micron scale deformable capacitors made from pairs of metallized polyimide plates. IFAs contract with an applied voltage of 30-120 V and have been shown to produce strains as large as 20% and forces of up to 8 dynes. The prototype transducer and actuator assembly was fabricated and interfaced with a GagePCI analog to digital conversion board digitizing 12 bit samples at a rate of 100 MSamples/second housed in a personal computer to create a single channel ultrasound scanner. The deflection of the table transducer in a low viscosity insulating fluid (HFE 7100, 3M) is up to +/-10 degrees at scan rates of 10-60 Hz.

The dual crystal chemistries give rise to dual electronic and dielectric properties that are anisotropic. The calculated electronic structure of SBT indicates that the absence of an energy gap in the vicinity of the Fermi level stems from lowering of the Sr orbital energies due to its lower electronegativity relative to Ta and Bi ions, and significant hybridization between Sr, Ta, Bi and O ions. Although charge carriers in the \"semimetallic\" (Sr(2)Ta(2)O(7))(2-) sublattice have a large effective mass, the (Bi(2)O(2))(2+) sublattice is insulating. The calculated partial and total densities of states provide alternative but plausible explanations to the reported spectroscopic data.

Thus, important discrepancies can sometimes be observed between theory and experiment. In this work, a simplified model of the resonator is assumed in order to extend the analysis of nonlinear behavior to any kind of nonlinear function, without a significant increase of mathematical complexity. Nevertheless, nonlinearities are considered to be weak enough to be taken as perturbations. An asymptotic method is used to obtain the first and second order perturbations of the response to an harmonic excitation applied to the system, and each one is separated into Fourier series. Nonlinearity is described by two functions-Phi, (S,D,S ,D ) and Psi (S,D,S ,D )-that must be added to the constitutive equations that give T and E as functions of S and D. These functions can be split into their symmetrical and antisymmetrical parts, which have different incidence over the perturbation terms. In order to simplify the problem, no mechanical excitation is considered, the electrical one is taken as strictly harmonic, and the current rather than the e.m.f. is taken as initial data. As an application example, this method is applied in order to find the second harmonic generation for a particular kind of nonlinearity."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18238626"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0885-3010","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","NlmUniqueID":"9882735","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/58.852075","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18238626","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The full set of electromechanical properties was determined using combined resonance and laser interferometry techniques. Ultra-high length extensional coupling (k(33)) of 0.94 was observed, a 25% increase over Navy Type VI PZT ceramics. The thickness extensional coupling (k(t)) of 0.48 was comparable to PZT compositions, and the compliance S(33)(E) was a factor of six greater. To maximize height extensional coupling (k'(33)), while minimizing length extensional coupling k(31) in array elements, it was necessary to align the elements along the 100 crystallographic direction in the x-y plane. Mode coupling plots and test samples for array elements determined that width-to-height ratios of less than 0.5 were desired, similar to the requirement for polycrystalline PZT ceramics. Modeling of 1-3 composites and experimental results demonstrated that thickness coupling greater than 0.80 could be achieved with a 40% to 70% volume fraction of PZN-PT. Although this is a substantial increase over PZT 1-3 composites, with a thickness coupling coefficient of 0.66, it represents a smaller fraction of the length extensional coupling k(33). This reduction may be a consequence of the increased compliance of PZN-PT, which results in significant clamping by the polymer matrix.

The results using the ARX model are compared with previous image formation techniques and also compared with the non-parametric method, i.e., spectral analysis. The results show that the ARX model has the comparable detection rate as RFCS and higher detection rate than BAI and RFS (except 6-microm air-filled channel in plastic trilaminate film) for channel in plastic trilaminate film. The ARX model has achieved the moderate contrast enhancement and ranks second in contrast-to-noise ratio enhancement among the compared techniques.

The guided-to-leaky mode conversion for an input optical beam at the wavelength of 632.8 nm by the induced diffraction grating from a collinear surface acoustic wave (SAW) is analyzed using a generalized multimode formulation of the coupled mode theory. Mode conversion efficiency and AO bandwidth have been calculated as functions of acoustic frequency, interaction length, guiding layer thickness, and acoustic drive power density for three cuts of the LiNbO(3) substrate. High performance configurations that are desirable for application to demultiplexing and switching in optical communication systems are identified, and the corresponding channel capacity and frequency resolution are determined. For example, it was shown that the X-cut configuration features the highest mode conversion efficiency. However, a relatively small AO bandwidth is associated with this configuration. Both high mode conversion efficiency and large AO bandwidth can be accomplished at the guiding layer thickness of 1.0 microm. A TM(o)-->TE(nu) mode conversion efficiency as high as 42% together with an AO bandwidth of approximately 70 MHz can be achieved in the Z-cut waveguide at the guiding layer thickness of 1.0 microm, acoustic drive power density of 50 mW/mm, interaction length of 40 mm, and acoustic frequency of 460 MHz. The corresponding channel capacity and frequency resolution are 745 and 0.09 MHz, respectively.

In previous work, the authors have proposed the use of multi-layer 1-3 PZT/epoxy composites to increase both but have encountered significant fabrication challenges. These difficulties include making the bond thickness between the layers extremely small relative to the ultrasound wavelength and aligning the posts of the composite to increase the coupling coefficient. The authors have routinely achieved a bond thickness of less than 5 mum but aligning the posts is more complicated. Finite element (PZFlex; Weidlinger, Assoc., New York, NY and Los Altos, CA) simulations show that the pulse-echo SNR and bandwidth degrade significantly with misalignment of the posts. Alignment of greater than 90% of the post pitch (i.e., tolerance of 10 to 20 mum) is required to obtain significant increases in SNR and bandwidth relative to conventional transducer arrays. This will be a difficult tolerance for large-scale production. Thus, the authors have developed a multi-layer composite hybrid array that will not require post alignment. This structure consists of a layer of 5 MHz 1-3 composite material on top of conventional 5 MHz PZT, which will provide greater SNR relative to conventional composites and increased bandwidth over multi-layer PZT. PZFlex simulations show that for a 2 MHz linear array element, the 2 layer hybrid structure increases the pulse-echo SNR by 7.5 dB over that from a single layer PZT element. Even without a matching layer, an increase in the -6 dB pulse-echo fractional bandwidth from 22% for the PZT element to 35% for the hybrid element was also predicted. Experimentally, in a 32 element array, the authors achieved an increase of 5.2 dB in SNR and an increased -6 dB bandwidth from 23 to 30%. In vitro and in vivo images showed corresponding improvements."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18238501"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0885-3010","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","NlmUniqueID":"9882735","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/58.775663","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18238501","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

A conventional ultrasonic motor has a flat contact surface slider and a hundredth driving frequency; so, the tangential motion caused by the elasticity of the slider and stator with regard to the spherical slider of the SAW motor requires further investigation. In this paper, a dynamic simulation model for the SAW motor is proposed. From the simulation result, the mechanism of the SAW motor was clarified (i.e., levitation and contact conditions were repeated during the operation). The transient response of the motor speed was simulated. The relationships between frictional factor and time constant and vibration velocity of the stator and the slider speed were understood.

A common assumption is that tissue displacement is constant within a short observation time used for time delay estimation (TDE). The precision of TDE is mainly limited by noise sources corrupting the echo signals. In addition to electronic and quantization noise, a substantial source of TDE error is the decorrelation of echo signals because of displacement gradients within the observation time. The authors present a theoretical model that describes the mean changes of the crosscorrelation function as a function of observation time and displacement gradient. The gradient is assumed to be small and uniform within the observation time; the decorrelation introduced by the lateral and elevational displacement components is assumed to be small compared with the decorrelation caused by the axial component. The decorrelation model predicts that the expected value of the crosscorrelation function is a low-pass filtered version of the autocorrelation function (i.e., the crosscorrelation obtained without gradients). The filter is a function of the axial gradient and the observation time. This theoretical finding is corroborated experimentally. Limitations imposed by decorrelation in displacement estimation and potential uses of decorrelation in medical ultrasound are discussed."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18238480"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0885-3010","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","NlmUniqueID":"9882735","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/58.775642","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18238480","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Three actuator characteristic parameters, (e.g., electromechanical coupling coefficient, maximum energy transmission coefficient, and maximum mechanical output energy) are discussed for cantilever bimorph and unimorph actuators. In the case of the bimorph actuator, if the effect of the bonding layer is negligible, these parameters are directly related to the transverse coupling factor lest. In the case of the unimorph actuator, these parameters also depend on the Young's modulus and the thickness of the elastic layer. Maximum values for these parameters can be obtained by choosing proper thickness ratio and Young's modulus ratio of elastic and piezoelectric layers. Calculation results on four unimorph actuators indicate that the use of stiffer elastic material is preferred to increase electromechanical coupling and output mechanical energy in unimorph actuators."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18238464"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0885-3010","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","NlmUniqueID":"9882735","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/58.764850","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18238464","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"2","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

This translation effect was labeled speckle-motion artifact. An image formation model has been shown to explain the phenomenon, pointing to the curvature of the imaging system point spread function (PSF) at the origin of this effect. The present paper extends this analysis and proposes a model, which predicts that a lateral motion artifact also would occur with shear motion. In the model, the artifact is found to be proportional to the shear angle and dependent of shear orientation, being maximal for shear that runs parallel to the axial direction; as for rotation, the artifact increases with frequency and beamwidth. This would mean that, when viewing a parabolic flow in the far field or with a highly curved PSF, an apparent contraction/expansion pattern in the direction of the vessel wall would be superimposed to the real velocity profile. In elastography, when viewing an inclusion subjected to an axial strain, four motion artifact regions are expected near the inclusion. The model is developed using the Fourier domain representation of the speckles for tissue-motion compensated signals, also called Lagrangian speckle. It can explain the artifact in terms of a simple spectral translation of a parabolic phase profile; given this, it is shown the artifact would be proportional to the lateral derivative of the axial displacement field. The spectral representation of Lagrangian speckle, for shear, also provides a simple geometrical interpretation for speckle decorrelation in terms of the shear strength and orientation, and in terms of the beam characteristics, i.e., the axial and lateral bandwidth."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"14","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18238459"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0885-3010","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","NlmUniqueID":"9882735","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/58.764845","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"18238459","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"2","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"2","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

It is shown that this problem can be solved by distribution learning and relaxation labeling, resulting in an efficient method that may be particularly useful in quantifying and segmenting abnormal brain tissues where the number of tissue types is unknown and the distributions of tissue types heavily overlap. The new technique uses suitable statistical models for both the pixel and context images and formulates the problem in terms of model-histogram fitting and global consistency labeling. The quantification is achieved by probabilistic self-organizing mixtures and the segmentation by a probabilistic constraint relaxation network. The experimental results show the efficient and robust performance of the new algorithm and that it outperforms the conventional classification based approaches."},"Language":"ENG"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18172510"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1057-7149","MedlineTA":"IEEE Trans Image Process","NlmUniqueID":"9886191"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1109/83.704309","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"PMC2171050","IdType":"pmc"},{"value":"NIHMS31658","IdType":"mid"},{"value":"18172510","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"4","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"4","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"1","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"4","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2008","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

We first show that regularized whitening preprocessing allows one to apply the original method successfully for a target with a correlated texture upon a correlated background. We then introduce a simple multiscale approach that increases the robustness of the segmentation against the initialization of the snake (i.e., the initial shape used for the segmentation).

A number of immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines appear likely to be registered soon and these will be dependent for efficacy upon new adjuvant formulations. The most useful to date have been the saponins e.g. QS-21, detox-B and Mycobacterial cells (either live as BCG, or killed). Vaccines to treat chronic infections will doubtless benefit from these developments. Adjuvant formulations and technologies exist to permit development of mucosal delivery, needle-free parenteral delivery and single dose vaccines. However, each of these will require intensive development, which will doubtless arrive when demanded by a specific application.

In most cases, HCV infection progresses to chronic liver disease and, subsequently, to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is transmitted by the parenteral route, for example by transfusion of blood or blood products, injection during drug abuse, etc., and by the inapparent parenteral route (penetration of the virus through difficult-to-identify microlesions present on the skin or mucosae), for example, sexual exposure or household exposure to infected contacts, etc. The cost of chronic hepatitis C and its sequelae is high in both financial and human terms. At present, only anti-HCV screening of blood/organ/tissue donors and universal precautions for the prevention of blood-borne infections are recommended for HCV prevention. Before the discovery of the main aetiological agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis (HCV), several randomised controlled clinical trials demonstrated that standard intramuscular immunoglobulin exerted a preventive effect on post-transfusional and sexual and /or horizontal transmission of non-A, non-B hepatitis. When serological tests for HCV infection became available, bimonthly inoculation of standard unscreened intramuscular immunoglobulin (prepared from plasma pools containing about 2% of anti-HCV-positive units) was demonstrated to significantly prevent sexually transmitted HCV infection. The immunoglobulin used contained high titres of anti-HCV neutralising antibodies (anti-E2 neutralisation of binding assay), whereas currently available commercial screened immunoglobulin (prepared from anti-HCV-negative blood units) did not. This finding suggested that anti-HCV neutralising antibodies are concentrated only in anti-HCV-positive units (which are currently discarded). Thus, anti-HCV hyperimmune globulin (HCIg) can be produced only from anti-HCV-positive units. The neutralising titre can be increased by the exclusive use of units with higher titres of neutralising antibodies. Unlike other hyperimmune globulins, which are produced from a limited number of selected donors, HCIg should be produced from a large number of units so as to contain neutralising antibodies to the different HCV strains. HCIg will have a number of advantages: (i) it is easy to produce and inexpensive; (ii) it has a long half-life, allowing infrequent administration; (iii) new additional viral inactivation procedures have been introduced to eradicate transmission of infection, and (iv) it may be possible to neutralise all the emerging HCV strains. HCIg could be used in all individuals at risk of HCV infection (sexual partners, haemodialysis patients, etc), in preventing reinfection of transplanted livers, and perhaps also in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, alone or associated with other drugs."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"20","Month":"05","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18031183"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-8804","MedlineTA":"BioDrugs","NlmUniqueID":"9705305","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"120406","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18031183","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"23","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"23","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"23","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Work carried out on animal tumour models and application in human therapeutics has suggested the potential value of an immunotherapeutic approach in haematological malignancies, especially in the setting of minimal residual disease. Extensive phase I/II trials have been conducted in all haematological diseases, but the most interesting results have been obtained in acute myeloid leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, where the possibility of achieving partial and complete responses in patients with advanced disease has been reported. The feasibility and immunomodulatory effects of IL-2 treatment in patients with minimal residual disease after high-dose chemotherapy have also been explored. However, the heterogeneity of cases treated and administration schedules used does not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn about the true impact of IL-2 treatment on the prognosis of these patients.

The first leukotriene modifiers tested (L-649,923 and tomelukast) had adverse gastrointestinal effects. Since then, several leukotriene modifiers have been marketed, including zafirlukast, zileuton and montelukast. Zafirlukast has been associated with 8 cases of Churg-Strauss syndrome, although these were probably not caused by zafirlukast. It is more likely that this syndrome is related to the underlying illness, which was masked by corticosteroids, and revealed after zafirlukast-mediated asthma treatment allowed steroid withdrawal and unmasking of underlying vasculitis. The main adverse effects of zileuton include liver function test abnormalities, while montelukast, the most recently marketed, has so far shown minimal adverse effects. Zafirlukast causes a decrease in warfarin clearance and a clinically significant increase in prothrombin time, probably by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme interactions.

This has led to the rapid growth of biological regulatory control of such products, with a plethora of regulations (often originally based on classical chemical drugs) in addition to case-by-case treatment by control authorities. There is a need for a relationship between industry and regulators using a scientifically based dialogue in order to establish appropriate scientifically based guidelines. These guidelines need to take into account increasing experience in manufacturing, sophisticated analytical techniques and the clinical use of biotherapeutics. Such dialogue must include a rationale of risk/benefit that is not unique to these products and therefore redresses the concept that complexity equates to potential hazard. Current regulatory issues are focused on the use of scientific experience and understanding to relate regulations produced during the early development of the bioindustry to the present use of these materials in the clinic and the realistic potential for difficulties when compared to chemical drugs. This covers such issues as toxicity, heterogeneity and analysis in relation to quality. When considering the significance of any issue for the regulation of a biological product it must be in relation to the type of product (e.g. homogeneous or heterogeneous) its clinical use (e.g. single or multiple dose form, life-threatening disease or not) and efficacy (e.g. complete cure, palliation or treatment adjunct) as each of these impinges on the scientific appropriateness of any control decision."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"20","Month":"05","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18031148"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-8804","MedlineTA":"BioDrugs","NlmUniqueID":"9705305","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"110601","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18031148","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"23","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"23","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"23","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Such products would have many advantages over existing contraceptives in that they would not elicit metabolic disturbances, would provide long-acting (i.e. 6 to 12 months) protection from pregnancy, be easy to administer, be economical to manufacture and distribute, and could, depending on their composition, be used by either men or women. Several lines of research and development currently in progress are aimed at the development of safe and effective immunocontraceptives based on reproductive hormones, components of the gametes (sperm and ova) and products of the early pre-implantation conceptus. The only prototype immunocontraceptives to have reached the stage of clinical trials in women are those based on the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin, and in men that based on follicle-stimulating hormone. However, extensive research is also underway on immunocontraceptives based on sperm and ovum components for use by women, and on immunocontraceptives based on sperm components and gonadotropin-releasing hormone for use by men. Before such preparations can be made available for wide-scale use, further research is needed on ways to overcome genetically determined variations in individual immune responses so that protective responses of a predetermined duration can be elicited in all recipients. It is anticipated that these technical problems can be solved and the clinical testing of lead products will be completed in the next decade. Almost all of the financial support for the research and development of immunocontraceptives has been provided by academic institutions and public sector agencies. In general, the pharmaceutical industry has not been willing to engage in new contraceptive development, largely because of concerns about product liability claims, anticipated low profitability and/or the risk of negative publicity. Therefore, the further development, manufacture and distribution of immunocontraceptives will probably require the collaboration of public sector agencies, governments and industry in order to overcome the current paucity of effort being put into the development and provision of new, safe, effective and acceptable methods of family planning. The purpose of this review is to provide information on the current status of research and development of potential immunocontraceptives and to attempt to stimulate pharmaceutical companies to reassess their positions with regard to the development, manufacture and distribution of these products."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18031108"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-8804","MedlineTA":"BioDrugs","NlmUniqueID":"9705305","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"080605","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18031108","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"23","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"23","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"23","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Early clinical trials of epoetin therapy in the setting of ABD have provided important information with respect to clinical safety, dose and erythropoietic response. Later trials of perisurgical epoetin therapy without ABD provided data on efficacy (i.e. reduced allogeneic blood exposure) that led to approval of epoetin in this setting. However, the epoetin doses (300 U/kg subcutaneously x 14 days) used in these trials, and their subsequent inclusion in labelling for the use of this product, are costly to administer. A recent study has indicated that weekly administration of epoetin 600 U/kg over 4 weeks is just as effective but less costly than a daily regimen over 2 weeks. The most cost-effective regimen that has been shown to minimise allogeneic exposure is preoperative epoetin therapy with 600 U/kg/ week x 2 plus 300 U/kg on the day of surgery, coupled with acute normovolaemic haemodilution in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy. A similar regimen of epoetin therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (2500 U/kg in divided doses over 2 weeks preoperatively) coupled with 'blood pooling', has also been described.

The drug is an effective therapy for selected haematological malignancies and is being tested in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), in whom the antilymphocytic effects of the drug may reduce the autoimmune destruction of myelin. With activity against resting and dividing cells that express high deoxycytidine kinase activity, cladribine causes prolonged, profound suppression of lymphocyte counts. Subcutaneous cladribine is 100% bioavailable and has no local tissue toxicity. Dosages used in clinical trials in patients with MS are in the range of 0.05 to 0.07 mg/kg/day subcutaneously for 5 days each month for 2 to 6 months. Temporary improvement or no change in neurological functioning and improvements in CNS lesions detected by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been seen after cladribine use in patients with chronic progressive (CPMS) and relapsing-remitting (RRMS) forms of MS. In a randomised double-blind study of 24 pairs of patients, improvement or stabilisation of CPMS for approximately 2 years was observed in cladribine-treated patients, whereas the disease progressed in placebo recipients. Another study of 159 patients found no progression in either the treated or placebo control group. In both studies, marked improvements were seen in gadolinium-enhanced CNS lesions. Cladribine-associated improvements in neurological functioning were also seen in some patients with RRMS in one study, which also noted a reduction in the frequency and severity of relapses. In this and a separate RRMS study, cladribine resulted in the regression of CNS lesions on MRI. Bone marrow suppression is the main dose-related toxicity; in patients with MS, use of low total cladribine dosages appears to limit myelosuppression. Although thrombocytopenia is of concern with higher-dose regimens (i.e. 2.8 mg/kg total dose) in patients with MS, granulocyte counts and haemoglobin levels appear to be largely unaltered. Cladribine treatment is also associated with culture- negative fever and a risk of infections in patients with haematological malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Further study of cladribine is needed to confirm present results in wider numbers of patients treated or followed up for longer durations, define optimum treatment and retreatment schedules for the drug and compare it with other agents. Nonetheless, cladribine therapy appears to have the potential to slow the progression of MS, reduce CNS lesions in patients with either the chronic progressive or relapsing-remitting forms of the disease and improve neurological functioning in some of these patients."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"26","Month":"05","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18020575"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-8804","MedlineTA":"BioDrugs","NlmUniqueID":"9705305","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"090506","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18020575","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Such analogues include insulins with single or multiple amino acid substitution(s) in the A or B chains of human insulin. The modification of the amino acid sequence results in a lower tendency towards aggregation of the insulin analogues when compared with human insulin. In particular, the subcutaneous injection of rapid-acting insulin analogues generates a peak that is superimposable on the peripheral plasma insulin profile of healthy individuals after a meal, without the need for a time interval between the injection and the meal. However, long term multicentre trials with rapid-acting insulin analogues have not shown an improvement in glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) values despite an improvement in post-meal (2 hour) glycaemic control. This result is probably due to the shorter action of insulin analogues compared with human regular insulin, causing higher glycaemic values at 4 hours after insulin administration despite lower values at 2 hours. Thus, the simple substitution of rapid-acting analogues for regular insulin can lead to a potential deterioration of metabolic control, causing hyperketonaemia in patients without residual C-peptide secretion. Such patients should receive supplemental intermediate insulin at bedtime and also, at low dosages and on the basis of glucose values, at any time the interval between meals is longer than 4 hours."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"26","Month":"05","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18020571"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-8804","MedlineTA":"BioDrugs","NlmUniqueID":"9705305","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"090502","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18020571","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Unlike FSH products derived from urine [menotropins (human menopausal gonadotrophins), urofollitropin and highly purified urofollitropin], follitropin alpha is readily available and shows batch-to-batch consistency. As well, it is free of luteinising hormone (LH) activity and contaminant urinary proteins and can be self-administered subcutaneously. In women undergoing in vitro fertilisation-embryo transfer (IVF-ET), follitropin alpha appears to have a greater stimulatory effect on follicular development than urine-derived FSH products as a group. In direct comparisons it had similar effects to urofollitropin but produced more oocytes per stimulated cycle than highly purified urofollitropin and menotropins. Preliminary results of 1 small trial indicate similar efficacy for follitropin alpha and follitropin beta. Rates of pregnancy, live births and multiple births have been similar among all treatment groups. As ovulation induction in women with clomifene-resistant WHO group II anovulation, follitropin alpha produces rates of ovulation, follicular development and pregnancy resembling those seen with urofollitropin or highly purified urofollitropin. A long term low-dose regimen of follitropin alpha is associated with a lower number of follicles and a trend toward fewer multiple births compared with conventional follitropin alpha or urofollitropin regimens. Data from women with WHO group I anovulation and from infertile men are scant. Tolerability has not differed between follitropin alpha and other FSH products. The incidence of general events (e.g. headache, nausea, ovarian cyst), local irritations at injection site and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome resembled those for comparator FSH products. However, it appears that follitropin alpha can be tolerated in instances of severe allergic reaction to urine-derived products. CONCLUSIONS: In women undergoing IVF-ET, follitropin alpha appears to have a greater stimulatory effect on follicle development than urine-derived FSH products as a group and is at least as well tolerated as these preparations; preliminary data indicate similar efficacy to follitropin beta. At present, its efficacy in women with WHO group II anovulation disorder has been shown to be similar to that of the older products. Compared with urinary FSH products, the benefits of follitropin alpha lie in its reliable supply, consistency of production, lack of contaminant urinary proteins and ease of self-administration. Given these practical advantages, and the apparently greater effect on follicular development overall in women undergoing IVF-ET, recombinant products such as follitropin alpha are expected to eventually replace older urine-derived FSH preparations and claim a prominent position in the treatment of infertility."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"27","Month":"05","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18020563"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-8804","MedlineTA":"BioDrugs","NlmUniqueID":"9705305","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"090306","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18020563","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

It is the first lysosomal storage disorder for which effective enzyme-supplementation therapy has become available. The enzyme, alglucerase, is glucocerebrosidase derived from human placental tissue; its oligosaccharide chain has been modified to expose terminal mannose residues, facilitating uptake in macrophages. Many patients have been shown to benefit from treatment with the enzyme. Spleen and liver volumes decrease and cytopenia improves. Over a longer period of time, bone involvement can also be diminished, although severe pre-existing bone abnormalities do not change. The safety profile of alglucerase seems excellent, with only few adverse events and approximately 12% of patients developing antibodies. Because long term safety is unknown and the enzyme is very expensive, studies have focused on the determination of the optimum individual dosage. Different dosages have shown to be effective, but so far the identification of patients who need a high or a low dosage is unclear. Other issues that deserve attention are the selection criteria for the initiation of treatment and the place of prophylactic treatment.

In common with endogenous and recombinant interferon-alpha molecules, interferon-alpha-n1 has antiviral, immunomodulatory and antiproliferative properties. Interferon-alpha-n1 shows some efficacy in immunocompetent adults with well-compensated chronic viral hepatitis B. Rates of complete virological response (defined as an absence of detectable hepatitis B virus-DNA in the serum) ranged from 5 to 79% of adults who received various dosage regimens of interferon-alpha-n1 in monotherapy trials. Clearance of hepatitis B 'e' antigen was reported in 5 to 70% of patients treated with the drug. Spontaneous virological responses occurred in 0 to 48% of untreated patients. The clinical efficacy of interferon-alpha-n1 in patients with chronic hepatitis B is not improved by concomitantly administered deflazacort, zidovudine or levamisole, but may be increased by a course of corticosteroid pretreatment in some patients. Interferon-alpha-n1 also shows therapeutic benefit in adults with chronic hepatitis C. Complete biochemical responses (defined as normalisation of serum ALT levels) were achieved in 27 to 60% of adult patients treated with the drug, whereas spontaneous normalisation of serum ALT levels occurred in up to 11% of untreated patients. Responses to interferon-alpha-n1 were temporary in 27 to 78% of treatment responders but were sustained in 6 to 40% of patients. Emerging data delineating baseline factors predictive of a positive response to interferon-alpha-n1 treatment may aid in the selection of patients with hepatitis B or C most likely to benefit from treatment with this drug. Most patients receiving interferon-alpha-n1 experience a transient 'influenza-like' syndrome during the first week of treatment. The syndrome, which is dose related and alleviated by paracetamol (acetaminophen), is characterised by fever, chills, and arthralgia. Dose-limiting adverse effects occurring during longer term interferon-alpha-n1 therapy include fatigue, myalgia, headache, depression, pruritus and seizures. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may also occur during interferon-alpha-n1 treatment. Autoimmune thyroid disease may develop in up to 9% of patients treated with interferon-alpha-n1 for >or=6 months. At present, interferon-alpha-n1 and the recombinant forms of interferon-alpha are the only drugs available for the treatment of adults with well-compensated hepatitis B or C. Interferon-alpha-n1 produces moderate response rates in adults with well-compensated chronic hepatitis B or C. Thus, it is positioned alongside recombinant interferon-alpha products as a useful first-line treatment option for patients with chronic hepatitis B or C."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"11","Month":"12","Year":"2009"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18020550"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-8804","MedlineTA":"BioDrugs","NlmUniqueID":"9705305","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"090204","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18020550","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

In contrast with urinary FSH (urofollitropin), follitropin is available in virtually unlimited quantities. Follitropin is as potent as urofollitropin in all protocols of ovarian stimulation. Furthermore, it shows an improved purity without contamination by urinary proteins not related to FSH, and can be injected subcutaneously by the patients themselves. In patients with complete luteinising hormone (LH) deficiency, follitropin stimulates follicular development, although serum levels of estradiol remain low. For this group of patients the addition of LH is necessary. Ongoing phase III studies on the use of recombinant LH in this indication will provide an answer to how much LH is needed in order to guarantee sufficient follicular growth and hormonal response. Gonadorelin (gonadotrophin releasing hormone; GnRH) analogues are used to avoid the surge of endogenous LH in ovarian stimulation protocols. Gonadorelin antagonists are now in clinical testing for the same indication. Gonadorelin antagonists allow sufficient suppression of endogenous LH levels. In contrast with gonadorelin analogues, they avoid any flare-up effect, i.e. an initial release of gonadotrophins from pituitary reservoirs. Recombinant gonadotrophins and gonadorelin antagonists are new tools towards a more individual approach to ovarian stimulation."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18020526"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-8804","MedlineTA":"BioDrugs","NlmUniqueID":"9705305","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"080504","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18020526","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Recently, however, HPV has emerged as the primary causative agent of cervical carcinoma, malignancy being associated with the presence of the viral genome (predominantly genotypes 16 and 18) in cancerous cells. The only HPV proteins reliably expressed in neoplastic lesions are the 'oncogenic' E6 and E7 proteins, that serve both as tumour-specific markers and potential targets for immunotherapeutic intervention. As intracellular (nuclear) proteins, the E6 and E7 gene products may be hidden from the humoral immune response. Attention has thus focused on the generation of a vaccine capable of inducing or stimulating a cellular immune response to HPV 16 and HPV 18 E6 and E7. Vaccine development has been constrained by the absence of an appropriate animal model, the oncogenic nature of E6 and E7 and technical difficulties associated with detection of cytotoxic T cell responses to these antigens. Despite these difficulties, vaccine strategies have now been devised based on immunisation with synthetic peptide, whole protein and a vaccinia virus recombinant. Phase I/II human clinical trials have been initiated, and preliminary results have demonstrated the induction of specific cellular immune responses after immunisation. The HPV-associated neoplasia in cervical cancer represents an excellent target for therapeutic intervention because the tumour-associated antigens are so clearly defined. As such, it provides an appropriate model for establishing the general principles of cancer immunotherapy in humans."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"18020523"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1173-8804","MedlineTA":"BioDrugs","NlmUniqueID":"9705305","Country":"New Zealand"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"080501","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"18020523","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

In addition, prehospital personnel soon may be administering therapies to patients with presumed stroke. We sought to determine the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of paramedic diagnosis of stroke in Mobile, Alabama, and to evaluate the impact of an educational program on paramedic diagnostic capability. Methods: We collected data from all paramedic-diagnosed stroke patients transported to a University of South Alabama hospital by Mobile Fire Medics. Final diagnosis was determined by a neurologist and classified as stroke or nonstroke (i.e., PPV). Paramedic diagnoses for all hospitalized stroke patients transported by Mobile Fire Medics were also reviewed (i.e., sensitivity). Sensitivity and PPV were calculated for the period 6/13/95 to 3/13/97. In addition, both indices were calculated for the period before (6/13/95 to 5/5/96) and after (6/25/96 to 3/13/97) an 8-week intensive educational program. Results: Seventy-one hospitalized stroke patients were transported by Mobile Fire Medics during the study period. Paramedics correctly identified 67 patients in total (94% sensitivity), 29 during the pre-education period (91% sensitivity), and 29 during the posteducation period (97% sensitivity; P=.33). Twenty-five patients were incorrectly diagnosed with stroke (73% PPV), 15 during the pre-education period (66% PPV), and 9 during the posteducation period (76% PPV; P=.30). Conclusion: Although paramedics in Mobile misdiagnose few patients with acute stroke, there is a tendency toward overdiagnosis. An educational intervention resulted in a trend toward improved accuracy of diagnosis, but this did not reach statistical significance."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17895125"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1052-3057","MedlineTA":"J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9111633","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S1052-3057(98)80130-4","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"17895125","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"23","PubStatus":"received","Month":"3","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"19","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"5","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"27","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"27","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"9","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"27","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Emphasizing outcomes management in clinical practice has also heightened the importance of quantitative evaluation using assessment scales. Investigators who evaluate, revise, and use assessment scales for the measurement of stroke impairment, disabilites, and handicaps face many challenges. These problems include the heterogeneity of stroke and the need to determine appropriate outcome measures, to use neurological deficit scales that can accurately predict disability, to ensure adequate follow-up, and to use scales that can be used outside of clinical trials by all health care professionals. Such scales should be easily and quickly administered, responsive, valid, and reliable. The most important categories of stroke scales are neurological deficit scales (e.g., Canadian Neurological Scale, European Stroke Scale, and National Institutes of Health [NIH] Stroke Scale), functional outcome scales (e.g., Barthel Index), and global outcome scales (e.g., Modified Rankin Scale). Although stroke-specific, health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) scales have yet to be developed and validated, general HRQL scales such as the Nottingham Health Profile, the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36, the Sickness Impact Profile, and the Health Utilities Index may be used to assess stroke patients.

These metabolic networks exhibit a rich variety of self-organized dynamic patterns, with e.g., phase transitions emerging in the whole activity of each network.

The cornea was modeled as a shell, and the equations for the deformations of a shell due to applanating and intraocular pressures were combined to model the behavior of the cornea during applanation tonometry. At certain corneal dimensions called the calibration dimensions, the applanating and intraocular pressures are considered to be equal. This relationship was used to determine the modulus of elasticity of the cornea and the relationship between the applanating and intraocular pressures. The true intraocular pressure (IOPT) was found to be related to Goldmann's applanating pressure (IOPG) as IOPT = IOPG/K, where K is a correction factor. For the calibration corneal thickness of 0.52 mm, the modulus of elasticity E in MPa of the human cornea was found to be related to the true intraocular pressure IOPT in mmHg as E = 0.02291OPT. The generalization of the Imbert-Fick law that takes into account the effect of corneal dimensions and stiffness was found to be given by IOPT = 73.5W/(K A), where W is the applanating weight in gf (gram force) and A is the applanated area in mm2. The calculated true intraocular pressure and modulus of elasticity were found to agree with published experimental results. The mathematical model developed may therefore be used to improve results from applanation tonometry and to estimate the mechanical property of the cornea in vivo."},"Language":"eng"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Cornea","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"physiology","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Elasticity","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Humans","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Intraocular Pressure","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Models, Biological","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Tonometry, Ocular","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}}]},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"09","Month":"10","Year":"2007"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17883231"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0092-8240","MedlineTA":"Bull Math Biol","NlmUniqueID":"0401404","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"17883231","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"10","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The reason for selecting these models was the fact that the probability density functions of the residence time of these models are formally similar to those of the Bateman and gamma-like function models, i.e., the two common deterministic models. Using published data, the analytical forms of the probability density functions of the residence time and the distributions of the simulated values of the residence time were determined on the basis of the deterministic models and the stochastic circulatory models, respectively. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed that even for 1000 xenobiotic particles, i.e., a relatively small number if the particles imply drug molecules, the probability density functions of the residence time based on the deterministic models closely matched the distributions of the simulated values of the residence time obtained on the basis of the stochastic circulatory models, provided that parameters of the latter models fulfilled selected conditions."},"Language":"eng"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Animals","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Blood Circulation","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"physiology","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Computer Simulation","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Guinea Pigs","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Humans","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Models, Cardiovascular","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Stochastic Processes","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Xenobiotics","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"blood","MajorTopicYN":"N"}}]},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"09","Month":"10","Year":"2007"},"Owner":"NLM","ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"NameOfSubstance":"Xenobiotics","RegistryNumber":"0"}},"PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17883215"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0092-8240","MedlineTA":"Bull Math Biol","NlmUniqueID":"0401404","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"17883215","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"10","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

In this study, two previously developed mathematical models (principal cell of the collecting duct and proximal tubule cell) are approximated by their linearizations about a reference condition. This yields matrices which estimate cell volume, cell composition, and transcellular fluxes in response to perturbations of bath conditions and membrane transporter activity. These approximations are themselves extended with the inclusion of linear dependence of membrane transport coefficients on cell variables (e.g., volume, solute concentrations, or electrical potential). This provides cell models with variable permeabilities, which may be homeostatic, and which can be examined systematically: sequentially testing each membrane permeability and its controlling cell variable. In the proximal tubule approximation, volume-mediated increases in peritubular K-Cl or Na-3HCO3 cotransport, and volume-mediated decreases in Na,K-ATPase activity are homeostatic; modulation of peritubular K permeability has little impact. In the principal cell model, volume homeostasis is afforded by volume-sensitive peritubular Na/H exchange or Cl- conductance. Predictions from the linear analysis are confirmed in the full models. This approach yields a systematic examination of homeostasis in an epithelial model, and identifies candidate control parameters."},"Language":"eng"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Algorithms","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Animals","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Biological Transport, Active","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Cell Size","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Cell Survival","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"physiology","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Epithelial Cells","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"metabolism","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Homeostasis","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Humans","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Ion Transport","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Ions","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"metabolism","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Kidney Tubules","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"cytology","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"metabolism","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Kidney Tubules, Collecting","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"metabolism","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Kidney Tubules, Proximal","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"metabolism","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Membrane Transport Proteins","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"physiology","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Models, Biological","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}}]},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"16","Month":"10","Year":"2007"},"Owner":"NLM","ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"NameOfSubstance":"Ions","RegistryNumber":"0"},{"NameOfSubstance":"Membrane Transport Proteins","RegistryNumber":"0"}]},"DateRevised":{"Day":"03","Month":"12","Year":"2007"},"PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17879871"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0092-8240","MedlineTA":"Bull Math Biol","NlmUniqueID":"0401404","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"17879871","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"9","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"17","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"10","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"21","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"9","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Two different pathways are involved in the downregulation process of the H(2) receptor: a cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent agonist-dependent pathway. Recently, it became evident that in the absence of an agonist the H(2) receptor expressed in CHO cells already stimulate cAMP production, also referred to as spontaneous activity. The spontaneous activity can be inhibited by several H(2) antagonists, previously thought to act as competitive antagonists, and these antagonists are referred to as inverse agonists. Some antagonists, e.g. burimamide, are not able to inhibit the spontaneous activity and are referred to as neutral antagonists. Inverse agonism appears to be the mechanistic basis of upregulation. Only inverse agonists and not neutral antagonists induce receptor upregulation after long-term treatment as these compounds inhibit the spontaneous receptor activity and thus the basal receptor downregulation. Moreover it might also explain previously reported observations after long-term treatment of gastric ulcers, such as intragastric hyperacidity."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"12","Month":"01","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17694373"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0925-4692","MedlineTA":"Inflammopharmacology","NlmUniqueID":"9112626","Country":"Switzerland"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1007/s10787-998-0033-1","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"17694373","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"3","PubStatus":"received","Month":"3","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"5","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"3","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"19","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"8","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"19","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"8","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"19","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"8","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Upon analysis there have been clear indications of elevation of liver enzymes being related to the drug in 3/753 patients who were investigated in clinical trials in osteoarthritis. The results of the analysis of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients with osteoarthritis (which is the principal indication for the drug) in PMS showed that the greatest number of these were in the skin and appendages, digestive system and organs wherein metabolic effects were manifest. There was a relatively low number of reports of gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage, and these observations are in agreement with published experimental studies in humans and laboratory animals. Recent reports of ADRs in the liver in 25 patients were analysed in detail. In many of the cases there was evidence of confounding disease (e.g. cancer, prior liver damage) or prior or concurrent intake of known hepatotoxic NSAIDs (diclofenac, aspirin). Often elevations of liver enzymes above the laboratory norms are the only indication of liver injury and this in many cases is variable. The major cases of elevated liver enzymes and other liver changes have been in elderly patients.This first extensive analysis of ADRs from a COX-2 selective NSAID, nimesulide, indicates that there is a relatively low incidence of ADRs especially in the gastrointestinal tract, while those in the liver are within or below the general incidence with other NSAIDs."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"12","Month":"01","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17657620"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0925-4692","MedlineTA":"Inflammopharmacology","NlmUniqueID":"9112626","Country":"Switzerland"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1007/s10787-998-0020-6","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"17657620","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"17","PubStatus":"received","Month":"7","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"19","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"8","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"28","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"28","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"28","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

It appears that these beneficial effects all together provide a particular network reflecting activity of a special peptidergic defence system. In support of this concept, it appears that there are interactions of this pentadecapeptide with many important systems (namely, dopamine-, NO-, prostaglandin-, somatosensory neurone-systems), that could provide a basis for the observed protective effects. Moreover, since disturbance of these systems' functions (i.e. dopamine-, NO-, somatosensory neuronal-system) which manifest either over-activity or as inhibition, may contribute to the multiple lesions in different organs. The reported evidence that this pentadecapeptide is able to counteract both their over-action, and their inhibition, may suggest this pentadecapeptide as a new, but most probably essential physiological defence system and that should be further investigated."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"12","Month":"01","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17657443"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0925-4692","MedlineTA":"Inflammopharmacology","NlmUniqueID":"9112626","Country":"Switzerland"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1007/s10787-999-0022-z","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"17657443","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"23","PubStatus":"received","Month":"11","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"29","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"1","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"28","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"28","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"28","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The more frequent use of azole antifungals and the recognition of isolates of Candida sp resistant to these and other drugs such as 5-fluorocytosine constitute a great need for a reproducible and useful C. albicans in vitro susceptibility testing method for monitoring antifungal therapy in clinical mycological laboratories. The E-test is a novel agar diffussion technique for testing the susceptibility of yeasts against a defined continous gradient of drug and could be used by most clinical laboratories. In this study the E-test and the NCCLS reference microbroth method (M27-P guidelines) were used to determine the MICs of amphotericin B, 5-flucytosine, itraconazole, fluconazole and ketoconazole for 50 clinical isolates of Candida albicans, Torulopsis glabrata, C. tropicalis and Hansenula anomala and five reference ATCC strains. The main purpose of the study was to compare the results obtained by the two methods. In general good agreement (+/- 1 dilution) was otained between both methods, despite differences observed for some species-antifungal combinations in which the MICs were lower by the E-test than by the microbroth method. MICs for C. albicans and T. glabrata to amphotericin B were < 0.50 microg/mL. Two isolates of C. albicans and two others of H. anomala, showed MIC < 8 microg/mL for 5- flucytosine. All isolates of T. glabrata and 40% of C. albicans showed MICs > 16 microg/mL for fluconazole. The results of this study indicate that E-test is an alternative for susceptibility testing to the NCCLS reference method. Because its simplicity it seems to be an easier test for routine clinical laboratories."},"Language":"spa"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17655386"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1130-1406","MedlineTA":"Rev Iberoam Micol","NlmUniqueID":"9425531","Country":"Spain"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"199714115","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"17655386","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"28","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"28","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"28","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The aim of this paper is to review the experience of the authors, including more than 1300 subclavian port placements, carried out during a five-year period, discussing possible causes and therapeutic options of this rare complication. Nine patients out of 1320 (0.68%) experienced this complication during the five-year period of this study. Two patients only showed a retrospective radiologic evidence of the 'pinch-off sign' (e.g. initial compression of the catheter at the costo-clavicular junction). No patients had symptoms from the embolised catheter fragment; the most frequent symptom (8 out of 9 cases) was a painful swelling around the port area during infusion, related to the extravasation of medications or fluids into the subcutaneous tissue. The site of embolised segment varied from azygos vein to right pulmonary artery; however, these findings did not affect the outcome, and all the embolised fragments were successfully retrieved through a transfemoral approach using a radiologic interventional technique. No fatality occurred. The catheter fracture and embolisation of the distal fragment are a well-known complication of subclavian central venous long-term cannulation, whose estimated overall incidence is 0.5-1%. Diagnosis is usually based on the radiologic appearance of the catheter compression (so called 'pinch-off sign'), which is far from being constant; a clinical suspicion can derive from intermittent malfunction, which claims differential diagnosis with the pres-ence of a fibrin sleeve around the tip of the catheter. Once diagnosed, the treatment is always an interventional radiologic approach, which has a very high success rate. When it fails, the possibility to leave the fragment embolised in the central veins, heart or pulmonary arteries, should be considered, being the thoracotomy and open catheter retraction questionable, at present time, in patients who have no symptoms and limited life-expectancy."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17638217"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1129-7298","MedlineTA":"J Vasc Access","NlmUniqueID":"100940729","Country":"Italy"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"17638217","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The drug causes gastrointestinal injury in humans and experimental animals. The aim of these studies was to examine the time course correlation between the macroscopic appearance of mucosal damage, tissue level of PGE(2) and adenosine nucleotide metabolism during the development of indomethacin (IND)-induced mucosal damage and its prevention by beta-carotene.The observations were carried out on both sexes of CFY-strain rats, weighing 180-200 g. Gastric mucosal damage was produced by subcutaneous administration of IND (20 mg/kg). beta-Carotene (Hoffman-La Roche, Switzerland) was given intragastrically at the time of IND administration at doses of 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg. The animals were sacrificed at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h after IND administration when the number and severity of mucosal lesions were noted and the tissue levels of ATP, ADP, AMP, cAMP, lactate and PGE(2) were measured from the total homogenate of gastric mucosa. The ratio of ADP/ATP, the values of the adenylate pool (ATP+ADP+AMP), and 'energy charge' [(ATP+0.5ADP)/(ATP+ADP+AMP)] were calculated.It was found that: (a) gastric mucosal lesions appear macroscopically 2 h after IND administration; (b) the tissue level of ATP decreased, while ADP was increased 1 h after administration; (c) the most significant decrease in cAMP was found 1 h after IND administration, and thereafter its level returned to baseline; (d) beta-carotene dose-dependently prevented the IND-induced mucosal damage and elevated the cAMP level, but it did not alter the mucosal PGE(2) level 3 or 4 h after IND administration; (e) beta-carotene produced an elevation in ATP and a decrease in ADP level; (f) no significant changes were found in 'energy charge' of the gastric mucosa in IND-treated animals.The development of gastric mucosal damage due to IND was associated with increased energy liberation, i.e. transformation of ATP into ADP, and decreased ATP-cAMP transformation. The significant decrease in cAMP preceded the macroscopic appearance of mucosal damage. The increase in ATP-cAMP transformation is involved in the development of beta-carotene-induced gastric cytoprotection."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"12","Month":"01","Year":"2010"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17638125"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0925-4692","MedlineTA":"Inflammopharmacology","NlmUniqueID":"9112626","Country":"Switzerland"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"10.1007/s10787-998-0004-6","IdType":"doi"},{"value":"17638125","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"19","PubStatus":"received","Month":"3","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"18","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"8","Year":"1997"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"20","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"7","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Type 1 diabetic children were compared with healthy control group. A set of relevant anthropometric indices was used to asses their physical development and fitness. Diabetic children were admitted to hospital with diabetic ketoacidoses, high blood glucose levels and severe dehydration. It was difficult to achieve stable long-term metabolic control because of acute infections , diatery lapses, frequent hypoglycemic attacks due to poverty and malnutrition, lack of intensive insulin therapy and glucose monitoring. It was found that diabetic children had higher heart rates (97.7 bts/min) and showed lower results when submitted to apnoeic test (20.6 sec) and tipping test (233.2 points). Stressful events that occurred within the family during the year prior to the clinical, onset of Type 1 diabetes were recorded on an inventory consisting of 45 questions. The total frequency of stressful life events were higher for diabetic children (95.4) than in the control group.(4.2). The relative frequencies of events that included actual or threatened loss within the family were significantly higher for the diabetic children (32-53%). In conclusion, severe emotional stress induced by life events such as the birth of another sibling, the influence of a step-parent, serious illness of the mother, marital separation or divorce of parents and the change in parent's financial status are associated with the onset of childhood diabetes and may be considered as risk factors."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17581025"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1022-9272","MedlineTA":"Afr J Health Sci","NlmUniqueID":"9439497","Country":"Kenya"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"17581025","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"6","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"6","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"6","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The results show a statistically significant negative relationship between individual decision to drink beer and health status. Thus, any policies geared at boosting perceived health status are likely to reduce the prevalence of beer drinking. Similarly, any policy interventions that are effective in discouraging beer drinking would improve individuals health status. Other results are that: beer drinking and cigarette smoking are complements; there is a positive relationship between individuals monthly income and his/her health status; the population groups which were politically, socially and economically deprived by a series of apartheid governments are more likely to abuse beer than their white counterparts; and there is a n-shaped relationship between individuals age and beer consumption.

The aim of this study was to estimate and compare the total and unit costs of providing care in Kilifi District hospital (KDH) and Malindi Sub-district Hospital (MSH). However, the specific objectives were: calculate the annual total cost of providing care in KDH and MSH; compare the unit costs for KDH with those of MSH; and demonstrate hospital costing methodology. The step-down procedure was used to apportion general costs to departments that provided direct patient care, i.e the wards and outpatient department. Results indicated that the Kenyan Government spent about Ksh 49.4 million and Kshs.22.7 million during the financial year 1993/94 on eh KDH and MSH, respectively. In KDH, the paediatrics ward absorbs the greatest proportion of inpatient department's share of the total cost; whereas, in MSH it is the maternity ward that consumes the greatest proportion. The KDH is more expensive than MSH even in terms of unit costs. For example, the cost per admission was Kshs.5,055 in KDH an dKshs.2,088 in MSH; cost per inpatient day was Kshs.445 in KDH and Kshs.365 in MSH; cost per bed was Kshs.119,590 in KDH and Kshs.112.064 in MSH; and cost per visit was Ksh.206 in KDH and kshs.118 in MSH. However it is likely that the level and quality of service provided between the two hospitals also differ. The public hospitals absorb a substantial proportion of the recurrent budget, so it is imperative that resource use and the role of the role (as district referral facility) in the district health system should be monitored and evaluated regularly."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17580998"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1022-9272","MedlineTA":"Afr J Health Sci","NlmUniqueID":"9439497","Country":"Kenya"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"17580998","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"6","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"6","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"22","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"6","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The results showed that the major causes of neonatal mortality in the region were low birth weight (LBW) (45%), congenital malformations (CM) (30.8%), infection (13.6%), and birth asphyxia (7.7%). The majority of the LBW infants died from respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The alimentary, central nervous and cardiovascular systems were the parts most commonly involved in CM, with cardiac defect accounting for the highest fatality rate due to lack of facilities for cardiac surgery in the region, and delay in effecting a transfer. Klebsiella, Serratia and E. coli are the predominant organisms causing neonatal sepsis, in contrast with the group B streptococcus dominating in America and the United Kingdom. Generally, factors causing neonatal deaths in the Asir region are similar to those reported in other tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia, and tally closely with observations in America and Europe, where the standard of health care is excellent. Nevertheless, the study indicates the need for upgrading of facilities, as well as for more trained personnel for obstetric and neonatal care in Asir region.

This double-blind randomized comparative study was undertaken to test its efficacy and safety in the treatment of SCD painful crises. Patients and Methods: Forty-three SCD patients (33 males and 10 females) with 44 episodes of pain were included in the study (i.e., one patient was included twice). Only those with painful crises requiring hospital admission were included. Patients were randomized to receive either isoxsuprine 5-10 mg, or meperidine 50100 mg intramuscularly, according to body weight, every four hours. A random selection of 23 patients received isoxsuprine, and 21 received meperidine. Pain score, duration of crisis, hospital stay, and side effects were monitored. Results: No significant difference was found in any parameter except for pain score at 30 and 60 minutes.

Since desferrioxamine administration attenuates this syndrome, non-transferrin-bound-iron (NTBI) released into the perfusing medium during CABG was implicated as a catalyst for oxygen radical formation. From 13 patients with \"redo\" CABG, specimens were collected from the coronary sinus (influx) and the aortic vent (efflux) after each distal coronary anastomosis. Specimens were subjected to sieving chromatography, and fractions were analyzed for total iron and NTBI using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). A statistically significant increase in NTBI was measured in influx (p = 0.002) and efflux samples (p = 0.023) collected after each graft. The combined amount of NTBI measured in these specimen was proportional to the CK-MB increase measured in the patients' sera on the day of surgery and the subsequent day. NTBI which accumulated in the circulatory bypass fluid during CABG may catalyze the generation of free radicals in the myocardium when body temperature is restored. This may aggravate myocardial damage as reflected by a post-surgical increase in CK-MB concentrations. Studies are in progress to develop new methods for the removal of NTBI during cardiac surgery. Tissue injury occurs with reperfusion during ischemia. This has been attributed to oxygen-derived free radicals that are generated by substances released from hypoxic areas (Kloner, Przyklenk et al., 1989; McCord, 1998). Reperfusion injury, i.e. the \"reperfusion syndrome,\" occurs after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) when the ischemic myocardium is again provided with a supply of blood. Its most serious manifestations are arrhythmia and myocardial stunning (Ar\"Rajab, Dawidson et al., 1996; Ferrari, Ceconi et al, 1996). The role of iron in reperfusion injury has been implicated by indirect evidence: during the reperfusion syndrome, the binding of iron with the chelator desferrioxamine (Ambrosio, Zweier et al., 1987; Bel, Martinod et al., 1996), or the administration of exogenous apo-transferrin, improved cardiac contractility and delayed manifestations of cardiac injury (Tiede, Sareen et al., 1990). Iron, as a transition metal, is able to catalyze free radical formation when released into the circulation from endogenous stores as non-transferrin-bound-iron (NTBI). This iron may be bound to small proteins or inorganic ligands (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1984; Pollock and Campana, 1980; Zweier, 1992). A method for the measurement of NTBI was recently developed (Ambrus, Stadler et al., 1999). The purpose of this study was to explore whether a correlation exists among (a) the amount of NTBI released during CABG surgery, (b) the length of time of myocardial ischemia, and (c) the myocardial damage that occurs during cardiopulmonary bypass."},"Language":"eng"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Aged","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Aged, 80 and over","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Cardiopulmonary Bypass","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Creatine Kinase, MB Form","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"blood","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Female","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Humans","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Iron","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"analysis","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Male","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Middle Aged","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Myocardium","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"enzymology","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"secretion","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Transferrin","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"analysis","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"secretion","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}]}]},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"07","Month":"03","Year":"2007"},"Owner":"NLM","ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"NameOfSubstance":"Transferrin","RegistryNumber":"0"},{"NameOfSubstance":"Iron","RegistryNumber":"7439-89-6"},{"NameOfSubstance":"Creatine Kinase, MB Form","RegistryNumber":"EC 2.7.3.2"}]},"DateRevised":{"Day":"17","Month":"11","Year":"2011"},"PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17312669"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0025-7850","MedlineTA":"J Med","NlmUniqueID":"7505566","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"17312669","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"23","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"8","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"3","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"23","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Patients and Methods: The questionnaire was designed to assess sleep habits, the degree of daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and specific sleep problems. A random sample of Saudi employees working as medical or paramedical personnel was selected. Results: There were 163 respondents (65%) comprising 33 females and 130 males. The mean ESS score was 9.4. Sixty-four respondents (39.3%) had an ESS score of more than 10, i.e., excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). When subjects with poor sleep habits and/or sleep problems were excluded, there were 65 ânormalâ sleepers, with a mean ESS score of 8.9+/-3.6. This did not differ from the rest of the sample population, who had a score of 9.8+/-3.7 (P=0.15). Subjects with inadequate sleep or insomnia consisted of 17 females (51.5%) and 45 males (34.6%). There were seven subjects, all males (5.4%), with habitual snoring. Ten males (7.7%) and two females (6.1%) reported having breathing pauses while asleep. Symptoms of restless leg syndrome, sleep paralysis, and cataplexy were reported by 21 (12.9%), 26 (16.0%) and two (1.2%) subjects, respectively. Conclusion: The prevalence of EDS in the Saudi population is higher compared to that reported from other populations when a Western ESS normal range is used. Nevertheless, the range of normal score of ESS is probably broader for Saudis compared to other populations. In general, sleep disorders are common but unrecognized in our community."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17277504"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0256-4947","MedlineTA":"Ann Saudi Med","NlmUniqueID":"8507355","Country":"Saudi Arabia"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"19-406","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"17277504","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"6","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"2","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"6","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"6","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"2","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The prevalence of contact dermatitis among tannery workers and cement-exposed workers is high. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of contact dermatitis among some Egyptian workers exposed to chromium and to investigate the role of patch test and IgE immunoassay in diagnosis of contact dermatitis. Eighty-three male workers who were exposed to chromium were selected after application of certain exclusion criteria to be the target population of this study. Forty male workers away from exposure to chromium were taken to be the controls. All the exposed and non exposed workers were investigated through an interview questionnaire, clinical examination, patch test and determination of blood and urine chromium levels, absolute eosinophilic count and total IgE level. The results showed that there was no significant difference between exposed workers with clinically diagnosed contact dermatitis and the clinically free exposed workers regarding age and work duration. 7.7% of exposed workers with positive patch test suffered from contact dermatitis while 31.6% of exposed workers with negative patch test suffered from contact dermatitis. There was no statistically significant difference between clinically diagnosed contact dermatitis workers and clinically free workers regarding blood and urine chromium levels. IgE level and absolute eosinophilic count were statistically higher among exposed workers with contact dermatitis than among clinically free exposed workers. According to the results of this study, it is concluded that the diagnosis of skin hypersensitivity to chromium should depend upon the history of chromium exposure, clinical examination and a battery of investigations including IgE level, eosinophilic count and patch test."},"Language":"eng"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Air Pollutants, Occupational","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"adverse effects","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"analysis","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Case-Control Studies","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Chromium","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"blood","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"poisoning","MajorTopicYN":"Y"},{"value":"urine","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Construction Materials","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Dermatitis, Contact","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"diagnosis","MajorTopicYN":"Y"},{"value":"epidemiology","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"etiology","MajorTopicYN":"Y"},{"value":"metabolism","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Dermatitis, Occupational","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"diagnosis","MajorTopicYN":"Y"},{"value":"epidemiology","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"etiology","MajorTopicYN":"Y"},{"value":"metabolism","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Egypt","Type":"Geographic","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"epidemiology","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Environmental Monitoring","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Eosinophils","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Humans","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Immunoassay","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Immunoglobulin E","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"blood","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Leukocyte Count","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Male","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Medical History Taking","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Middle Aged","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Occupational Exposure","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"adverse effects","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"analysis","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Patch Tests","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Physical Examination","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Prevalence","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Questionnaires","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Tanning","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Threshold Limit Values","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Time Factors","MajorTopicYN":"N"}}]},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"16","Month":"02","Year":"2007"},"Owner":"NLM","ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"NameOfSubstance":"Air Pollutants, Occupational","RegistryNumber":"0"},{"NameOfSubstance":"Immunoglobulin E","RegistryNumber":"37341-29-0"},{"NameOfSubstance":"Chromium","RegistryNumber":"7440-47-3"}]},"PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17219860"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0013-2446","MedlineTA":"J Egypt Public Health Assoc","NlmUniqueID":"7505602","Country":"Egypt"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"17219860","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"16","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"17","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"16","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Moreover, it aimed to detect hepatitis markers in saliva samples corresponding to the positive sera. Different risk factors associated with hepatitis infection and detectability rate of hepatitis markers were also studied. METHODOLOGY: enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique was used to detect the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti HBc), e antigen (eAg) and antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti HCV) both in serum and saliva samples. HCV RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Oral examination was performed for assessment of simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S), Papillary Bleeding Index (PBI), probing pocket depth and loss of fibre attachment. RESULTS: cases with periodontal disease showed higher percentages of hepatitis exposure (hepex; anti HCV and/or anti HBc) and significantly higher anti HCV seropositivity than the controls (26% and 13% versus 22% and 8%, respectively). No difference in HBsAg carrier rate nor in anti HBc seropositivity was elicited. Furthermore, cases with periodontal disease showed higher detectability rate of HBsAg, anti HBc, anti HCV or both anti HCV and/or anti HBc in whole unstimulated saliva than the controls (100% vs 66.7%, 50% vs 23.5%, 23.1% vs 0.0% and 42.3% vs 18.2%, respectively). Stepwise logistic regression delineated two significant factors associated with the risk of hepatitis exposure, the first predictor was the rural residence and the second one was the history of blood transfusion (OR=3.10, 2.94, respectively). Periodontal disease, severity of bleeding and bad oral hygiene were associated with the risk of hepatitis infection and with the detectability of hepatitis markers in the whole saliva."},"Language":"eng"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Adult","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Blood Transfusion","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"adverse effects","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Case-Control Studies","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Egypt","Type":"Geographic","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"epidemiology","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Female","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Gingivitis","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"complications","MajorTopicYN":"Y"},{"value":"diagnosis","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"epidemiology","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"prevention & control","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Health Education, Dental","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Hepatitis B","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"blood","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"epidemiology","MajorTopicYN":"Y"},{"value":"etiology","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"prevention & control","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Hepatitis B Core Antigens","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"analysis","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"blood","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Hepatitis B Surface Antigens","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"analysis","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"blood","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Hepatitis C","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"blood","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"epidemiology","MajorTopicYN":"Y"},{"value":"etiology","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"prevention & control","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Hepatitis C Antibodies","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"analysis","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"blood","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Humans","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Logistic Models","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Male","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Mass Screening","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Oral Hygiene Index","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Periodontitis","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"complications","MajorTopicYN":"Y"},{"value":"diagnosis","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"epidemiology","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"prevention & control","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Population Surveillance","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Questionnaires","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Risk Factors","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Rural Health","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":{"value":"statistics & numerical data","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Saliva","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"chemistry","MajorTopicYN":"N"},{"value":"virology","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Seroepidemiologic Studies","MajorTopicYN":"N"}}]},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"16","Month":"02","Year":"2007"},"Owner":"NLM","ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"NameOfSubstance":"Hepatitis B Core Antigens","RegistryNumber":"0"},{"NameOfSubstance":"Hepatitis B Surface Antigens","RegistryNumber":"0"},{"NameOfSubstance":"Hepatitis C Antibodies","RegistryNumber":"0"}]},"PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17217032"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0013-2446","MedlineTA":"J Egypt Public Health Assoc","NlmUniqueID":"7505602","Country":"Egypt"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"17217032","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"16","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"17","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"16","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

The mean number of working years was higher among the vaccinated group. More than 55% of personnel who had direct exposure or contact with blood were not vaccinated. HB vaccine uptake was conducted at the work place by 65.6% of vaccinated personnel and about 50% received the vaccine recently, i.e. less than one year. The side effects experienced by vaccinated subjects were local pain (5.4%) and headache (0.7%).

This translates into a potentially significant public health problem: how far is the risk associated with these devices? Another risk is expected from the cellular towers or base stations, which transmit and receive these electromagnetic waves. Usually, these base stations should be constructed over residential buildings to cover all areas. Considering the increased public awareness about electromagnetic fields (EMF) exposure associated with these towers, this work aimed at investigation and evaluation of authorized environmental safety conditions for some mobile base stations in different districts of Alexandria city. The different mobile base stations were investigated for 12 standard safety specifications of the buildings' roofs on which mobile base stations are constructed. Although some of the standard specifications in the examined base stations were in compliance with standard specifications, some items were not in a safe condition. Only base stations F & G had complete safe conditions for all investigated items because of being erected on lighting towers of a sports stadium. On the other hand, base stations C, D, E, I, J, K, L1 & L2 needed a raise in the height of the antennas over buildings' roofs of 1-4.5 m. However, base stations C, D, H, K, L1 & L2 may pose a risk to near living population and consequently the towers have to be moved away. The violating distances are 3, 5.5, 3, 4.5, 4, 3 meters, respectively, while the environmental standard is 6 m. Therefore, the towers should be moved away from these populated areas Nevertheless, guided directions should be constructed in all base stations to warn close living population. Safety regulations as well as frequent inspection need to be applied, on both Egyptian mobile phone companies, to ensure the application of all standard specifications. A significant research effort is needed to assess the risk to human health of wireless communication devices."},"Language":"eng"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Egypt","Type":"Geographic","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Electromagnetic Fields","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Environmental Health","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Humans","MajorTopicYN":"N"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Safety","MajorTopicYN":"Y"}},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Telecommunications","MajorTopicYN":"N"},"QualifierName":[{"value":"standards","MajorTopicYN":"Y"},{"value":"utilization","MajorTopicYN":"N"}]},{"DescriptorName":{"value":"Urban Population","MajorTopicYN":"N"}}]},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"13","Month":"02","Year":"2007"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17216927"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"0013-2446","MedlineTA":"J Egypt Public Health Assoc","NlmUniqueID":"7505602","Country":"Egypt"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":{"value":"17216927","IdType":"pubmed"}},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"16","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"14","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"2","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"16","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Fifty-seven craniopharyngiomas in 42 patients were selected for retrospective analysis. The yttrium-90 was implanted intracavitally, using computerized tomography-guided and three-dimensional stereotactic treatment planning. The cumulative dose aimed at the inner surface of the cyst wall was 300 Gy. An average of 75% shrinkage of the initial cyst volume was observed. In 18 cases the reduction was more than 91%, and the cyst disappeared totally in 11 cases. A 50% decrease in cyst volume was usually apparent between the 2nd and 4th months. A 70% decrease in cyst volume was seen by the 5th and 6th months and an 80% reduction by the 7th and 8th months. Cysts that were unchanged remained so throughout the observation period. The time course of volume reduction could be expressed mathematically by the formula of 0.73 X e(-0.62 X T) + 0.27, where \"e\" is the basic number of natural logarithm and \"T\" is the time expressed in months. Mean survival duration after intracavitary irradiation was 9.4 years. The shrinkage of the cyst was a consequence of fibrosis of the wall, as seen on histopathological examination. The neuroophthalmological prognosis was favorable only when the optic disc was normal or nearly normal at the time of the treatment. In the presence of preexisting optic atrophy, visual deterioration proved to be irreversible. The long-term results support the view that intracavitary (90)Y-irradiation is a noninvasive and very effective method of treatment for craniopharyngioma cysts. Because of the 1.1 mm half-life decay of beta irradiation, it cannot influence the solid part of the tumor; therefore, the best result can be expected in solitary cysts."},"Language":"eng"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17206778"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1092-0684","MedlineTA":"Neurosurg Focus","NlmUniqueID":"100896471","Country":"United States"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"030606","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"17206778","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"9","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"1","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"9","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"1","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"9","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"1","Year":"2007","Hour":"9"}]}}}},

Staphylococci resistant to these mixtures are always resistant to the A compounds but are not necessarily resistant to the B compounds. Resistance to A compounds and to the mixtures is conferred by acetyltransferases or ATP-binding proteins via unknown mechanisms. Several genes encoding each of the two categories of protein have been characterized and regularly detected on plasmids. Genes encoding lactonases, which inactivate B compounds, have been occasionally detected on these plasmids. Staphylococci which harbour plasmids conferring resistance to A compounds should not be treated with the mixtures even if they appear susceptible in vitro. Indeed, susceptibility to the mixtures of staphylococci carrying resistance to A compounds has often been attributed to partial loss of the plasmids conferring this resistance. When staphylococci are constitutively resistant to B compounds, the in vitro activities of the mixtures should be evaluated, because they are better correlated than MICs with their efficacy in therapy."},"Language":"eng"},"DateCompleted":{"Day":"28","Month":"06","Year":"2007"},"Owner":"NLM","PMID":{"Version":"1","value":"17092802"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"ISSNLinking":"1368-7646","MedlineTA":"Drug Resist Updat","NlmUniqueID":"9815369","Country":"Scotland"}},"PubmedData":{"ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":[{"value":"S1368-7646(98)80036-8","IdType":"pii"},{"value":"17092802","IdType":"pubmed"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"Day":"10","PubStatus":"received","Month":"2","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"5","PubStatus":"revised","Month":"3","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"17","PubStatus":"accepted","Month":"3","Year":"1998"},{"Day":"10","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"pubmed","Month":"11","Year":"2006","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"10","Minute":"1","PubStatus":"medline","Month":"11","Year":"2006","Hour":"9"},{"Day":"10","Minute":"0","PubStatus":"entrez","Month":"11","Year":"2006","Hour":"9"}]}}}}]
